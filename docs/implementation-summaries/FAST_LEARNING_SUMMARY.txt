FAST LEARNING FIX - RESULTS
================================================================================

Date: Friday, January 9, 2026

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:
  ✅ Removed MiniNet relevance multiplication (was killing discrimination)
  ✅ Increased weight growth 5x (10x → 50x for faster convergence)
  ✅ Populate context during training (not just generation)

EXPECTED RESULT:
  With relative competition, 1-2 iterations should achieve 0% error
  Iteration 1: Correct edges +50, wrong edges 0
  Iteration 2: Correct edges dominate (50 vs 0 = infinite ratio!)
  
ACTUAL RESULT:
  ❌ Still 77.8% error after 1000 iterations
  ❌ Output stuck at "wo wo wo " (looping)
  ❌ No improvement over time

DIAGNOSIS:
  
  Issue: Generation Loop Stuck
    • Output repeats "wo wo wo" indefinitely
    • Suggests cycle: w → o → w → o → ...
    • Loop detection not working
    • Stop condition not triggering
  
  Issue: Wrong Path Selected
    • Expected: ' ' → w → o → r → l → d
    • Actual:   ' ' → w → o → w → o → ...
    • After 'o', should select 'r', but selects 'w' instead
  
  Possible Causes:
    1. Generation loop has no max length check
    2. Edge 'o' → 'r' not created or too weak
    3. Edge 'o' → 'w' exists (backwards) and is stronger
    4. Loop detection broken

WHAT'S WORKING:
  ✅ Fixes implemented correctly
  ✅ Graph stable (9 nodes, 13 edges)
  ✅ Weights bounded (avgW = 239)
  ✅ No crashes

WHAT'S BROKEN:
  ❌ Generation loop stuck in cycle
  ❌ Can't verify if relative competition works (hidden by loop bug)
  ❌ No improvement over iterations

ROOT CAUSE:
  Generation loop bug preventing proper output
  
  The relative competition SHOULD work (fixes are correct),
  but we can't see it because generation gets stuck in "wo wo wo" loop.

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Add max output length to generation loop
  2. Fix loop detection
  3. Print edge weights to verify they're growing correctly
  4. Check if edge 'o' → 'r' exists
