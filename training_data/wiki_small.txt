The Month

April comes between March and May, making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as June, September and November are later in the year.

April begins on the same day of the week as July every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year, as each other's last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.

In common years, April starts on the same day of the week as October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as January of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.

In years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, June of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.

April is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn/fall month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word "aperire", meaning "to open", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.

April in poetry
Poets use April to mean the end of winter. For example: April showers bring May flowers.

August
August (Aug.) is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between July and September. It has 31 days. It is named after the Roman emperor Augustus Caesar.

August does not begin on the same day of the week as any other month in common years, but begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years. August always ends on the same day of the week as November.

The Month
thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar, after whom August is named]]
This month was first called Sextilis in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735&nbsp;BC with Romulus. October was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700&nbsp;BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450&nbsp;BC (Roman writers disagree). In 153 BC January 1 was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for Augustus Caesar who became Roman consul in this month. The month has 31 days because Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC. August is after July and before September.

August, in either hemisphere, is the seasonal equivalent of February in the other. In the Northern hemisphere it is a summer month and it is a winter month in the Southern hemisphere.

No other month in common years begins on the same day of the week as August, but August begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years. August ends on the same day of the week as November every year, as each other's last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.

In common years, August starts on the same day of the week as March and November of the previous year, and in leap years, June of the previous year. In common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as March and June of the previous year, and in leap years, September of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, August starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year.

In years immediately before common years, August starts on the same day of the week as May of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, October of the following year. In years immediately before common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as May of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, February and October of the following year.

Art is a creative activity. It produces a product, an object. Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, performing subjects, and expressing the author's thoughts. The product of art is called a work of art, for others to experience.

Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay bowl that can be used. That kind of art is sometimes called a craft.

Those who make art are called artists. They hope to affect the emotions of people who experience it. Some people find art relaxing, exciting or informative. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner creativity.

"The arts" is a much broader term. It includes drawing, painting, sculpting, photography, performance art, dance, music, poetry, prose and theatre.

Art is divided into the plastic arts, where something is made, and the performing arts, where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.

 Plastic art
 Fine art is expression by making something beautiful or appealing to the emotions by visual means: drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture
 Literature: poetry, creative writing
 Performing art
 Performing arts are expression using the body: drama, dance, acting, singing
 Auditory art (expression by making sounds): music, singing
 Practical art
 Culinary art (expression by making flavors and tastes): cooking
 The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: architecture, filming, fashion, photography, video games)

What "art" means
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind, spirit and soul. Art can also be an Idea or a concept that is expressed visually. An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it. Some people also get inspired.

The first and broadest sense of "art" means "arrangement" or "to arrange." In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors or forms next to each other to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting look. Art can also be an existing object that is presented and called art, this is called re contextualizing. This is often done by placing the object in a frame or a special setting like a Gallery were the new setting gives the object a different meaning or message. (Marcel Duchamp, Fountain, 1917)

The difference between Art and design can be subjective to the viewer and hard to distinguish. Art is often said to have a message or a meaning and design is about only the appearance.

Art may express emotion. Artists may feel a certain emotion or message and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience. However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion or the message as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.

History of art
There are sculptures, cave painting and rock art dating from the Upper Paleolithic era.

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient Egypt, India, China, Greece, Rome and Persia had works and styles of art. In the Middle Ages, most of the art in Europe showed people from the Bible in paintings, stained-glass windows, and mosaic tile floors and walls.

Islamic art includes geometric patterns, Islamic calligraphy, and architecture. In India and Tibet, painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included jade carving, bronze, pottery, poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.

In Europe, after the Middle Ages, there was a "Renaissance" which means "rebirth". People rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented perspective where things in the distance look smaller in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other. These artists used nudity regularly in their art.

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to Modernity created many new painting styles such as Classicism, Romanticism, Realism, and Impressionism. The history of twentieth century art includes Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, and Minimalism.

Roles of art
In some societies, people think that art belongs to the person who made it. They think that the artist put his or her "talent" and industry into the art. In this view, the art is the property of the artist, protected by copyright.

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a collective that has made the art, through the artist.

Functions of art
The functions of art include:

1) Cognitive function

 Works of art let us know about what the creator thought or knew, and what the surroundings of the author were like, real or imagined.

2) Aesthetic function

 Works of art can make people happy by being beautiful or evoke any of the emotions.

3) Prognostic function

 Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...

4) Recreation function

 Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) Value function

 What did the artist value? What aims did they like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) Didactic function

 What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

A
thumb|Writing "A" in cursive font.

A is the first letter of the English alphabet. The small letter, a, is used as a lowercase vowel. 
Overview
alt=Writing vowel "A"|thumb|Writing "A" in block font
When it is spoken, ā is said as a long a, a diphthong of ĕ and y. A is similar to Alpha of the Greek alphabet. That is not surprising, because it means the same sound. "Alpha and Omega" (the last letter of the Greek alphabet) means from beginning to the end. In musical notation, the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below B and above G.

A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old TV show, The A-Team. A capital a is written "A". Use a capital A at the start of a sentence if writing. A is also a musical note, sometimes referred to as "La".
Origin
The letter 'A' was in the Phoenician alphabet's aleph. This symbol came from a simple picture of an ox head. 
{| class="wikitable"

|}
This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter alpha. The Greek alphabet was used by the Etruscans in northern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.

Using the letter
The letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like æ, in the International Phonetic Alphabet, such as the word pad. Other sounds of this letter are in the words father, which developed into another sound, such as in the word ace.

Use in mathematics
In algebra, the letter "A" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.

In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label line segments, lines, etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.

Its letter shape is referred to abstractly in Sir William Vallance Douglas Hodge's 5th postulate, the basis for, as one of the Millennium Prize Problems, the Hodge Conjecture.

Air
thumb|A [[wikt:fan|fan moves air.]]

Air is the Earth's atmosphere. Air is a mixture of many gases and tiny dust particles. It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has mass and weight, because it is matter. The weight of air creates atmospheric pressure. There is no air in outer space.

Earth's atmosphere is composed of about 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.1 percent other gases.

Animals live and need to breathe the oxygen in the atmosphere. In breathing, the lungs put oxygen into the blood, and send back carbon dioxide to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off the oxygen that we breathe. Without it animals die of asphyxia.

Air can be polluted by some gases (such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides), smoke, and ash. This air pollution causes various problems including smog, acid rain and global warming. It can damage people's health and the environment. There are debates about whether or not to act upon climate change, but soon enough the Earth will heat up too much, causing it to become too hot and not support life. Some say fewer people would die of cold weather, and that is true but there is already a huge amount of people dying from heat and that number is and will keep increasing more and more.

Since early times, air has been used to create technology. Ships moved with sails and windmills used the mechanical motion of air. Aircraft use propellers to move air over a wing, which allows them to fly. Pneumatics use air pressure to move things. Since the late 1900s, air power is also used to generate electricity.

Air is invisible: it cannot be seen by the eye, though a shimmering in hot air can be seen.

Air is one of the 4 classical elements (water, air, earth and fire).

Main history

Original atmosphere
At first it was mainly a hydrogen atmosphere. It has changed dramatically on several occasions—for example, the Great Oxygenation Event 2.4 billion years ago, greatly increased oxygen in the atmosphere from practically no oxygen to levels closer to present day. Humans have also contributed to significant changes in atmospheric composition through air pollution, especially since industrialisation, leading to rapid environmental change such as ozone depletion and global warming.

Second atmosphere
Out gassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases.

Third atmosphere
[[File:OxygenLevel-1000ma.svg|thumb|Oxygen content of the atmosphere over the last billion years]]

The constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide was transferred to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago. The Great Oxygenation Event is shown by the end of the banded iron formations.

Autonomous communities of Spain
Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities. Autonomous means that each of these autonomous communities has its own executive, legislative, and judicial powers. These are similar to, but not the same as, states in the United States of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In 1978 these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called "historic communities": Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the sole official language in every autonomous community but six, where Spanish is co-official with other languages, as follows:
 Catalonia: Catalan and Occitan
 Valencian Community: Catalan (also called Valencian there)
 Balearic Islands: Catalan
 Galicia: Galician
 Basque Country: Basque
 Navarre: Basque (only in the north and near the border with the Basque County)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

 Andalusia (its capital is Sevilla)
 Aragon (its capital is Zaragoza)
 Asturias (its capital is Oviedo)
 Balearic Islands (its capital is Palma de Mallorca)
 Basque Country (its capital is Vitoria)
 Canary Islands (they have two capitals - Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife)
 Cantabria (its capital is Santander)
 Castile-La Mancha (its capital is Toledo)
 Castile and León (its capital is Valladolid)
 Catalonia (its capital is Barcelona)
 Extremadura (its capital is Mérida)
 Galicia (its capital is Santiago de Compostela)
 La Rioja (its capital is Logroño)
 Community of Madrid (its capital is Madrid)
 Region of Murcia (its capital is Murcia)
 Navarre (its capital is Pamplona)
 Valencian Community (its capital is Valencia)

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: Ceuta and Melilla. They are called "autonomous cities" and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.

Alan Turing
right|thumb|A [[statue of Alan Turing]]
thumb|right|Turing had the idea of the 'bombe', a mechanical computer. Details were added by others, and it was built by a Post Office engineer. This is a rebuild of the original

Alan Mathison Turing (London, 23 June 1912 – Wilmslow, Cheshire, 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician and computer scientist. He is known as the father of computer science. He was born in Maida Vale, London.

Early life
Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father came from a Scottish merchant family. His mother, Ethel Sara Stoney, was the daughter of an engineer from Ireland. Turing was very good at math when he was young.

Education
He went to school at St. Michael’s in St Leonards-on-Sea. Later, he studied at Cambridge University and Princeton University.

Career
In 1936, Turing wrote about a theoretical machine called the Turing machine. This idea became important in the development of computers. He also created the idea of a computer program.

During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park. He helped break secret German messages made by the Enigma machine. This helped the Allies win the war and may have saved millions of lives.

He worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), using cryptanalysis to break Nazi codes. Later, he helped design the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first stored-program computers. He presented the design in 1946.

Turing was also interested in artificial intelligence. He proposed the Turing test to check if a machine can "think".

Private life
Turing was homosexual. In 1952, he admitted to having sex with a man. At that time, being gay was illegal in the UK. He was convicted and had to choose between prison or taking hormones to reduce his sex drive. He chose the medicine. This caused him health problems like impotence and breast growth.

Death
In 1954, Turing died from cyanide poisoning. Some say he ate a poisoned apple, but the apple was never tested. It is believed he died by suicide.

Legacy
In 2009, a petition asked the UK Government to say sorry for how Turing was treated. Prime Minister Gordon Brown later gave an apology and called Turing's treatment "appalling".

In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II gave him a royal pardon.

The “Turing Law” was later passed to pardon other men who were punished under old anti-gay laws.

Andouille is a type of pork sausage. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork meat, fat, intestines (tubes going to the stomach), and tripe (the wall of the stomach).

Other sorts are "French andouille" and "German andouille"; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra salt, black pepper, and garlic. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

Farming
thumb|250px|Farming in [[Ancient Egypt]]
Farming is growing crops and keeping animals for food and raw materials. Farming is a significant part of agriculture.

History
thumb |upright=1.35 | 
thumb|250px|Farming in Wiltshire
thumb|250px|[[Flax]]

Farming began in different parts of the world, independently; There were at least 11 separate centers of origin.

Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC; Later came domestication of mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan c. 10,500 years ago. 

The development of farming gave rise to the Neolithic Revolution as people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in cities.

Farming and domestication probably started in the Fertile Crescent (the Nile Valley, the Levant and Mesopotamia). The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt. Wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew. 

Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 4200 BC.

Livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats were taken to the Americas, from the Old World. The first of those horses, came with the Spanish conquistadors (or soldiers and explorers) in the 1490s. Moving those cattle, sheep, goats and horses, were part of the Columbian Exchange.

People probably started agriculture by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than hunter-gatherers can feed on the same amount of land.

This allowed the human population to grow to such large numbers as there are today.

Types
Arable farming means growing crops. This would include wheat or vegetables.
Growing fruit means having orchards devoted to fruit. They cannot be switched easily with growing field crops. Therefore, they are not classed as arable land in the statistics.

Many people still live by subsistence farming, on a small farm. They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. The yield is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated, and they have less money to buy equipment. Drought and other problems sometimes cause famines. Where yields are low, deforestation can provide new land to grow more food. This provides more nutrition for the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years.

In some countries, farms are often fewer and larger. During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land. There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more.

This kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, pesticides (chemicals that kill bugs), and herbicides (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can pollute the soil or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by erosion (blowing or washing away), salt builddup, or loss of structure. Irrigation (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.

Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and nutritional value. They also choose plants that can survive plant disease and drought, and are easier to harvest. Centuries of artificial selection and breeding have changed crop plants. The crops produce better yield. Fertilizers, chemical pest control, and irrigation all help.

Some plants are improved with genetic engineering. One example is modifying the plant to resist herbicides.

Livestock
Farms may also keep animals. That is called animal husbandry. If they are used to make meat for people to eat, that is livestock production. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, are kept for their produce. "Produce" here means their eggs and milk, which are sold by the farm, usually in markets. Large animals need grassland of some kind for grazing. What they need depends on the animals. Goats eat a much wider range of plants than cows. In some parts of the world, that makes goats a more sensible choice for a farmer than cows.

Food
thumb|Sinai palm dates farming
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.
 Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.
 Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers.
 Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure.
 Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.

Agricultural policy means the goals and methods of agricultural production. Common goals of policy include the quality, amount, and safety of food.

Problems
There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today.
These include:
 Pollution
 Erosion
 Diseases
 Pests
 Weeds
 Drought
 Rainfall
 Climate: Earth warming is an important example
 Contamination

There are also difficulties with the distribution of food:
 Warfare: see Nigerian Civil War (Biafran War) for an example. See Russia–Ukrainian war for another example.
 Distribution: Difficulties with moving product from grower to consumer. It is expected that this difficulty will increase in future. The reasons for this are complex, but one important factor may be the absence of a dominant international naval power. The British Navy provided protection against pirates in the 19th and early 20th century, and the US Navy protected shipping after WWII. The US is still a dominant naval power, but its power will soon be based on its small number of huge aircraft carriers. They will not deal with small boats full of armed pirates, which is the usual way piracy is done. So we can expect grain ships (etc) will have to carry any protection they may need, or they will have to go the long way around. That means avoiding the shortcuts into the Mediterranean. Other kinds of warfare, such as we see in Ukraine, add to the problem of shipping food products safely.

Crops
In produced weight, these crops are the most important (global production in metric tonnes):

The figure for sugarcane is rather deceptive. It omits sugar beet, but includes the weight of the woody stalk. Most of the plants which produce food are in the grass family Poaceae.

Arithmetic
In mathematics, arithmetic is the basic study of numbers. The four basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, although other operations such as exponentiation and roots are also studied in arithmetic.

Other arithmetic topics includes working with negative numbers, fractions, decimals and percentages.
Overview
Most people learn arithmetic in primary school, but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. 
Applications
A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters, plumbers, mechanics, accountants, architects, doctors, and nurses. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, science, and engineering.

Some arithmetic can be carried out mentally. A calculator can also be used to perform arithmetic. Computers can do it more quickly, which is one reason Global Positioning System receivers have a small computer inside.

Examples
 2+3=5 (addition is commutative: 2+3 is the same as 3+2)
 7-5=2 (subtraction is not commutative: 7-5 is different from 5-7)
 3\times4=12 (multiplication is commutative: 3\times4 is the same as 4\times3)
 6/2=3 (division is not commutative: 6/2 is different from 2/6

Addition
Not to be confused with building extensions which are also called additions.
thumb|220px|Addition

In mathematics, addition, represented by the symbol +, is an operation which combines two mathematical objects together into another mathematical object of the same type, called the sum. Addition can occur with simple objects such as numbers, and more complex objects and concepts such as vectors and matrices.

Addition has several important properties. It is commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not matter, and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter (see Summation). Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting. Addition of 0 does not change a number. Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication.

Arithmetic
In arithmetic, addition is the operation where two or more numbers called "addends" are used to make a new number, which is the "sum" or total that is expressed with the equals sign. The symbol for addition, in infix notation, is the plus sign "+" placed between the operands.
alt=Two plus three is equal to five.|thumb|2 [[shapes + 3 shapes = 5 shapes]]

Counting examples
For example, there are objects in two groups (as shown on the right). The objects are various shapes, where one group has 3 of them while the other has 2. When the two groups combine into one, the overall amount (sum) of the shapes become 5.

Vertical Addition
The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred eighty six and four hundred sixty seven. The problem's digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds (see Place value).

First, the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, with the 3 written below and the 1 ten carried to the tens column. Next, in the tens column, the 1, 8, and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, with the 5 written below and the 1 hundred carried to the hundreds column. Finally, in the hundreds column, 1, 7, and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, with the 2 written below and the 1 thousand carried to the thousand column. The final answer is thus one thousand two hundred fifty three.

A measurement example
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300&nbsp;m east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120&nbsp;m east of Bob's house:

Tom's house	\leftarrow	300&nbsp;m	\rightarrow	Bob's house	\leftarrow	120&nbsp;m	\rightarrow	Sally's house

The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house, added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house, is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, 300 m plus 120&nbsp;m.
300+120=420
Hence Sally's house is 420&nbsp;m to the east of Tom's house.

Properties

Commutativity
right|113px|thumb|4+2=2+4 with blocks
Addition is commutative, meaning that one can change the order of the numbers in a sum, but still get the same result. For example:
4+5=9 and 5+4=9

Associativity
left|100px|thumb|2+(1+3)=(2+1)+3 with parts of a cylinder
Addition is also associative, which means that when three or more numbers are added together, the order of operations does not change the result.

For any three numbers a, b, and c, it is true that 1=(a+b)+c=a+(b+c). For example, 1=(1+2)+3=3+3=6 and 1=1+(2+3)=1+5=6, which means that 1=(1+2)+3=1+(2+3).

When addition is used together with other operations, the order of operations becomes important. In the standard order of operations, addition is to be computed later than exponentiation, roots, multiplication and division, but has equal importance as subtraction.

The country is divided up into six states and two territories, and more than half of Australia's population lives in and around the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. The first people to live in the country were the Indigenous Australians: many of them died from smallpox during colonisation.

Australia is known for its mining (coal, iron, gold, diamonds and crystals). It produces wool, and is the world's largest producer of bauxite. Its emblem is a flower called the golden wattle.

Australia is also known for its animals. The national symbols of Australia are the kangaroo and the golden wattle. Scientifically, perhaps even more important are its two monotreme mammals: the platypus and the echidna.

Geography
thumbnail|Map of Australia
thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types of Australia]]

Australia's landmass of is on the Indo-Australian plate. The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many animals and plants live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the kangaroo, the koala, the emu, the kookaburra, the wallaby and the wombat. The duck-billed platypus and the echidna are completely unique.

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. For the history of Australia, see History of Australia.

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from Britain, became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first Prime Minister of Australia was Edmund Barton in 1901. Australia is a member of the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations. It is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy with King Charles III as King of Australia and Head of State and a Governor-General who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the King in Australia.

Regions and cities

Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania (which is a large island). The two major mainland territories are the Northern Territory (which is huge) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) which is not much more than a city.

The population is about 26 million people (2021 census = 25,890,773). Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Newcastle and the Gold Coast. The largest inland city is Canberra, which is also the nation's capital. The largest city is Sydney.

Australia is a very large country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly a hot desert. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable climate (not too hot and dry) for farms and cities. The island state of Tasmania has a more balanced climate than much of the mainland.

Climate change
All the capital cities except Perth and Darwin are in the south-east of the country. There is now increasing rainfall and flooding which affects this region, which is ominous [threatening]. It is thought this is caused by climate change, and may continue to get worse. The BBC report comments: "In the past three years, record-breaking bushfire and flood events have killed more than 500 people and billions of animals. Drought, cyclones and freak tides have gripped communities". The BBC report continues: "Nowhere is this a bigger issue than in Queensland. It is home to almost 40% of the 500,000 homes projected to be effectively uninsurable". This means people can't get insurance because the risk of flooding (in one season) or fire (in another season) is too great.

History

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree in 1900]]
thumb|upright=1.0|right|[[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal rock art in the Kimberley region of Western Australia]]

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people arrived in Australia about 60,000 years ago or maybe even earlier. Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now. Every few years, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would burn the grass and small trees. This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos and wallabies like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos and wallabies that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Sometimes, Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in Victoria and Tasmania. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

Terra Australis
In the 1600s, Dutch merchants traded with the islands of Batavia (now Indonesia), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent Abel Tasman on a voyage of discovery and he found Tasmania, which he named Van Diemen's Land. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The British Government was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain James Cook to the Pacific Ocean. His ship, HMS Endeavour, carried the famous scientists, Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Solander who were going to Tahiti where they would watch the planet Venus pass in front of the Sun. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find "Terra Australis" (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found New Zealand and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon. Captain Cook named that bit of land Point Hicks. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw "New South Wales". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing, hunting along with collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the mainland in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.

Settlement
thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip raises the British flag at Sydney in 1788.]]

In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and gaols (jails) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hanged for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.

By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the First Fleet of eleven ships set sail from Portsmouth carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain Arthur Phillip. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.

Captain Phillip found that Botany Bay was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbour called Port Jackson, which he said was "the finest harbour in the world". There were many small bays on the harbour so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.

For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.

The little group of tents had a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food. Soon it grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to Norfolk Island and to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.

Exploration
thumb|[[Matthew Flinders went round the whole continent of Australia. Australia was first called Terra Australis.]]

Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on. When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the Blue Mountains. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and a 17-year-old called William Charles Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, Lachlan Macquarie founded the town of Bathurst on the other side, 160&nbsp;km (100 miles) from Sydney. Bathurst became Australia's first inland settlement.

Some people, like Captain Charles Sturt were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. Ludwig Leichhardt got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major Thomas Mitchell was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The Henty brothers had come from Tasmania, had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.

Self government

The gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people very rich.

The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. William Wentworth started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand democratic government. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. New South Wales Legislative Council had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the right to vote was given to all men over 21 in South Australia. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the Parliament of South Australia in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.

Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

The Commonwealth of Australia
thumb|300px|A painting of the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia, 9 May 1901, painted by Tom Roberts. Australia has had democracy since the 1850s.]]
[[File:Australian PR COB 2006.PNG|right|300px|thumb|Countries of birth of Australian estimated resident population, 2006.Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics]]

Until 1901, Australia was not a nation, it was six separate colonies governed by Britain. They voted to join to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the British Empire, and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, its own Army and its own Navy.

In Australia at this time, the trade unions were very strong, and they started a political party, the Australian Labor Party. Australia passed many laws to help the workers.

In 1914, the First World War started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli, in the Ottoman Empire. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day. They also fought on the Western Front. More than 60,000 Australians and New Zealanders were killed.

In 1932, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened.

Australia had a really hard time in the Great Depression of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against Nazi Germany when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the Fall of Singapore by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the United States Navy, the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States and Japan.

When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from Italy and Greece, other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon. An important new party, the Liberal Party of Australia was made by Robert Menzies in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then Gough Whitlam won for the Labor Party. Whitlam made changes, but he made the Senate unhappy and the Governor-General sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then Malcolm Fraser won a few elections for the Liberal Party.

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from China, Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries in Asia. Australia became more multicultural. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, than Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against dictatorships in Korea and Vietnam and later Iraq. Australian soldiers also helped the United Nations in countries like East Timor in 1999.

In 1973, the famous Sydney Opera House opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of Australian movies, actors and singers became famous around the world. In the year 2000, Sydney had the Summer Olympics.

In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, then the Liberal Party under John Howard made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad recession in 1991, but when other Western countries had trouble with their economies in 2008, Australia stayed strong.

Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like Uluru) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aboriginals are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as immigrants to live in Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are refugees. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after World War Two, including around 660,000 refugees.

Julia Gillard became the first woman Prime Minister of Australia in 2010 when she replaced her Labor Party colleague Kevin Rudd (who later replaced her).

Politics
thumb|right|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives in Canberra]]
thumb|right|[[Anthony Albanese (Labor) is the current Prime Minister since 2022.]]

Australia is part of the Commonwealth of Nations. Australia is made up of six states, and two mainland territories. Each state and territory has its own Parliament and makes its own local laws. The Parliament of Australia sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or Federation.

The Federal government is led by the Prime Minister of Australia, who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is Anthony Albanese.

The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the Governor-General represents the King of Australia, who is also the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as head of state. The Governor-General, currently His Excellency Sam Mostyn, is chosen by the Prime Minister.

Australia constitutionally is a Constitutional Monarchy meaning that the Monarch has little power and in Australia must be neutral in Australian politics 

Culture
thumb|right|A [[Greece|Greek festival in Australia]]
thumb|right|Australian [[fish and chips]]

Australia was colonised by people from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland who also brought "blackbirded" people from mostly Melanesia, but today people from all over the world live there. English is the main spoken language. Christianity is the main religion, though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is multicultural: all its people are encouraged to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning English and joining in with other Australians. Australia has many immigrants from different countries around the world.

Famous Australian writers include the bush balladeers Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Colleen McCullough. In 1973, Patrick White won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.

Australian music has had world-wide stars, for example the opera singers Nellie Melba and Joan Sutherland, the rock and roll bands Bee Gees, AC/DC and INXS, the folk-rocker Paul Kelly (musician), the pop singer Kylie Minogue and Australian country music stars Slim Dusty and John Williamson. Australian Aboriginal music is very special and very ancient: it has the famous didgeridoo woodwind instrument. thumb|A fancy [[didgeridoo]]

Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas. Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, Home and Away and Neighbours are examples. It has had well known TV stars, such as Barry Humphries (Dame Edna Everage), Steve Irwin (The Crocodile Hunter) and The Wiggles. Major Australian subgroups such as the Bogan have been shown on Australian TV in shows such as Bogan Hunters and Kath & Kim.

Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multicultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has its daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.

Australian movies have a long history. The world's first feature movie was the Australian movie The Story of the Kelly Gang of 1906. In 1933, In the Wake of the Bounty, directed by Charles Chauvel, had Errol Flynn as the main actor. Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. The first Australian Oscar was won by the 1942 Kokoda Front Line!, directed by Ken G. Hall. In the 1970s and 1980s Australian movies and movie stars became world famous. There were movies like Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli (with Mel Gibson), The Man From Snowy River and Crocodile Dundee. Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger became global stars during the 1990s and Australia starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman made a lot of money in 2008.

Australia is a popular destination for business conferences and research, with Sydney one of the top 20 meeting destinations in the world.

Sport
thumb|150px|[[Don Bradman]]

Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities. 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities. The most popular sports are Australian rules football, rugby league and cricket. In international sports, Australia has very strong teams in cricket, hockey, netball, rugby league and rugby union, and performs well in cycling, rowing and swimming. Local popular sports include Australian Rules Football, horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer Olympic Games since 1896, and every Commonwealth Games. Australia has hosted the 1956 and 2000 Summer Olympics, and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games and are to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the Australian Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television programs include the Summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.

The main sporting leagues for men are the AFL (Australian rules football), the NRL (rugby league), the A-League (soccer) and the NBL (basketball). For women, they are the AFLW (Australian rules football), ANZ Netball Championships (netball), the W-League (soccer) and WNBL (basketball).

Famous Australian sports players include the cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, the swimmer Ian Thorpe, the cricketer Shane Warne and the athlete Cathy Freeman.

Art festivals
Just 60 years ago, Australia had only one big art festival. Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community-based festivals, and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms.

Indigenous life
Australia is home to many animals and plants that can be found nowhere else on Earth, except perhaps New Guinea.

The platypus and the short-beaked echidna are unique, and are two of the only five surviving monotremes. Monotremes are only found in Australia and New Guinea.

Koalas, kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, numbats and many others are marsupials. Most of the marsupials in the world are found only on the continent or on the neighbouring island of New Guinea. Wildfires from global warming in 2020 have reduced their population.

Trees
The gum trees are almost as remarkable as the animals. They are mainly Eucalypts and other gum trees. These are woody evergreens which make essential oils and are prone to fire. Sticky heavily scented gum squeezes out of their wood. The tribe has about 860 species. They are all native to Southeast Asia and Oceania. Most live in Australia. Until British settlement in Australia, these trees were almost entirely unknown. They had been separated from the Americas, Africa and much of Asia for millions of years.

American English, or US English, is the dialect of English that is spoken in the United States. It is different from other types of English like British English. Most types of American English came from local dialects in England. During the 18th and 19th centuries, pronunciation changed less in America than in England.

Use
Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country that speaks another type of English. They hear and read American English through the media, such as movies, television, and the Internet, where the most common form of English is American English.

Because people all over the world use English, many new words are used. English has been changing that way for hundreds of years. For example, the millions who speak Indian English frequently add American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from the various Indian languages.

Some people learn American English as it is spoken in the United States. For example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English to sound more like their customers who call from America. Those people often keep using American English in everyday life.

Spelling

There are many words that sound the same in both American and British English but have different spellings. British English often has more traditional ways of spelling words than American English.

Vocabulary
There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English.:
 aeroplane is called "airplane"
 ladybird is called "ladybug"
 lift is called "elevator"
 toilet is called "bathroom", "restroom" or "comfort station"
 lorry is called "truck"
 nappies are called "diapers"
 petrol is called "gas" (or "gasoline")
 the boot of a car is called a "trunk"
 a dummy is called a "pacifier"
 trousers are called "pants"
 underground is called "subway"
 football is called "soccer"
 braces are "suspenders" ("suspenders" in British -English are a type of clothing that is worn around the lower leg to stop socks/sox from sagging or around the upper leg by people wearing stockings)

Regional accents
General American English is the kind most spoken in mass media. It more vigorously pronounces the letter "r" than some other kinds do. Non-rhoticity ("R"-dropping) is frequent in certain places in which "r" is not pronounced after a vowel such as in the words "car" and "card," which sound like "cah" and "cahd" in places like the Boston area. 
Here are some regional accents of American English:

Appalachian English - This is the stereotypical hillbilly accent, is completely rhotic, and can even add "r" in words such as "warsh" for "wash."

General Southern - This is a range of accents tending to be rhotic or semi-rhotic and to have glide deletion in which "I" is converted to broad "a."

Tidewater English - A non-rhotic ("r"-dropping) southern variety that also has a "Scottish" or "Canadian" raising of the "ow" diphthong in words like "house," "about," and "brown."

Charleston and Savannah English - Almost extinct, these accents that are non-rhotic

Boston English (also East New England English) - This is the most famous non-rhotic American accent, and most other non-rhotic American varieties often get compared to it. Aniother Bostonian feature is the limited Canadian raising of the "ow" diphthong before voiceless consonants in words like "house" and "about."

New York City English - One of the most recognizable dialects in the US, it is characterized by variable non-rhoticity or semi-rhoticity and a rounding of the long o sound, making "coffee" and "thought" sound like "cawfee" and "thawt."

South Louisiana English - This group of non-rhotic accents can be heard in New Orleans and its surrounding areas. It can be described as a combination between New York City English and Southern American English.

Northern Midwest English - This area has accents that tend to sound a lot like Canadian English.

Valley girl and surfer dude - This accent is common to Southern California and has features like "vocal fry" (creaky voice) and "upturn" at the ends of sentences.

Aquaculture
thumb|The Delta Pride Catfish farms.

Aquaculture is the farming of fish, shrimp, abalones, algae, and other seafood. Aquaculture supplies fish, such as catfish, salmon, and trout. It was developed a few thousand years ago in China. Aquaculture supplies over 20% of all the seafood harvested. 

Fish farming has been practiced, in some parts of the world, for thousands of years. Goldfish originated about a thousand years ago in carp farms in China, and the Roman Empire farmed oysters and other seafood. Today, half of the seafood eaten in the U.S. is farmed. To help meet the growing global demand for seafood, aquaculture is growing fast.

The environmental impact of fish farming varies widely, depending on the species being farmed, the methods used and where the farm is located. When good practices are used, it's possible to farm seafood in a way that has very little impact to the environment. Such operations limit habitat damage, disease, escapes of farmed fish and the use of wild fish as feed.

Abbreviation
An abbreviation is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. 

In English

The English language occasionally uses the apostrophe mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. 

Borrowed Latin phrases

More often, they use periods, especially the ones that come from the Latin language, which include i.e. [id est] (that is), e.g. [exempli gratia] (for example) and et al. [et alia] (and others).

Some new abbreviations have been created by scientists, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the Internet. People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are acronyms.

Examples

Here are examples of common acronyms: The word "radar" is an acronym for "Radio Detection and Ranging". The name of the large computer company IBM comes from the words "International Business Machines". The name of the part of the United States government that sends rockets into outer space is NASA, from the words "National Aeronautics and Space Administration". 

When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write "LOL" to mean "Laughing Out Loud". People sometimes write "ASAP" for "As Soon As Possible".

Angel

In many mythologies and religions, an angel is a good spirit. The word angel comes from the Greek word angelos which means "messenger". Angels appear frequently in the Old Testament, the New Testament, Qur'an and Aqdas.

Different references to angels throughout the Bible suggest different kinds and ranks of angels, such as seraphs (Hebrew plural: seraphim) or cherubs (Hebrew plural: cherubim). This resulted in medieval theologians outlining a hierarchy of such divine messengers, including not only cherubs and seraphs, but also archangels, powers, principalities, dominions and thrones.

The study of angels is called angelology.

In the Bible
Angels are powerful spirits that obey God's commands. They sometimes appear to humans in a human form. They can deliver messages to people in person or in dreams. Angels that are named in the Bible are Michael (called a "chief prince"), Gabriel (known for telling Mary that she would be the mother of Jesus), and Raphael (in the Apocryphal Book of Tobit). The Ethiopian Book of Enoch also lists four Archangels which watch over the four parts of heaven; Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel. Lucifer is also known as an angel in the Bible.

Appearances in Genesis
God, in the Book of Genesis sends an Angel with a sword made out of fire to keep Adam and Eve from going back to the Garden of Eden. 
 He later sends an angel to Hagar to tell her not to run away from Abraham and that she will give birth to Ishmael. 
 After Abraham is circumcised, three men come to him to tell him that his wife Sarah will give birth to a son Isaac and they turn out to be angels. 
 Two angels pretending to be human go to Sodom and Gomorrah to see if there are ten good people there but there aren't so one of them destroys Sodom and the other rescues Lot and his family. 
 When Abraham sends Hagar and Ishmael away later, an Angel of God comes to her to help them. 
 When Jacob runs away from Esau, he falls asleep and has a dream about angels climbing up and down a ladder. When Jacob goes back to Canaan, he fights a man who turns out to be an Angel and wins. Jacob says he'll let the Angel go if the Angel gives him a blessing so the Angel changes Jacob's name to Israel. Jacob asks the Angel "what is your name?" and the Angel asks Jacob why he wants to know.

Appearances in Exodus
In the Book of Exodus, an Angel comes to a bush and makes a fire but the bush doesn't burn. When Moses sees this, he comes close to the Bush and he hears God speak to him. On the way to Egypt, Moses forgets to circumcise his son so an Angel tries to kill him but then Zipporah circumcises him and the Angel lets Moses live. Angels are also there when God gives the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai.

Appearances in Leviticus
In the Book of Leviticus, the Ark of the Covenant, has statues of two angels called Cherubim on top of it.

Appearances in Numbers
In the Book of Numbers, Balaam goes to curse the Israelites but God sends an Angel to be a Satan against Balaam. Balaam doesn't see the Angel but his donkey does so she moves out of the way. Balaam then hits her and gets her to go continue moving. When the donkey sees the Angel again and Balaam doesn't, she moves to the other side of the road and Balaam hits her and she starts walking again. When she sees the Angle again and there's nowhere on the road to go, she stops moving, so Balaam hits her. Balaam's donkey then talks to him and asks him why he's hitting her. He says if he had a sword, then he would kill her. Then Balaam sees the Angel and the Angel tells Balaam that Balaam's donkey is more righteous than he is and that he would have only killed Balaam but not the donkey.

Appearances in Deuteronomy
When Moses spoke to the Israelites in the Book of Deuteronomy, there were ten thousand angels next to him.

Appearances in Judges
God sends an Angel to Gideon in the Book of Judges to tell Gideon that he must save the Israelites. He later sends an Angel to an Israelite woman and her husband Manoach to tell them that they would have a son Samson.

Appearances in Samuel
When King David has a census, God punishes him by sending an Angel to cause a plague.

Appearances in Kings
When Queen Jezebel wants to kill Elijah, an Angel comes to help him. Another Angel later protects Elisha. When King Ahab asks the prophet Micaiah for a prediction, Mecaiah tells him that God sent an Angel to trick Ahab into fighting a war and getting killed. Later when Sannecherib attacks Judah, God sends His Angel to kill Sannecherib's entire Assyrian army.

Isaiah
Isaiah said that the Angels sang songs and that every Angel had six wings, two for covering its face, two for covering its feet and two for flying. Isaiah said that when he heard the Angels sing he said "I am doomed for I live among a people of unclean lips" and that God got angry with him for saying that.

Ezekiel
The Book of Ezekiel begins with Ezekiel seeing Angels on a Chariot.

Zechariah
The prophet Zechariah saw an Angel tell him that God would have mercy on the Jews. And that their enemies will be punished. Another Angel says that even the Kingdom of Israel will come back to the land. Zechariah sees an Angel defending the Priest from The Satan when The Satan says that the Priest did a bad thing. An Angel shows Zechariah a Menorah in the Temple of Jerusalem. The Angel tells Zechariah that the children of Zerubavel will be Kings.

Malachi
God told Malachi that He would send an Angel and Elijah to announce that the Messiah was coming.

Job
In the Book of Job, all the Angels meet with God and The Satan bets God that he can make Job curse God

Daniel
In the Book of Daniel, an Angel rescues Daniel's friends from Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel also mentions Angels being named Michael and Gabriel

Chronicles
In the Books of Chronicles, The Satan gets King David to want to have his census.

Appearances in The New Testament
In the New Testament, an Angel tells The Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Jesus, Angels proclaim the birth of Jesus in the Adoration of the shepherds (Luke 2:10) and Angels help Jesus in the desert.

In Luke 22:43 of the New Testament, an Angel comforts Jesus during the agony in the garden of Gethsemane and in Matthew 28:5 an Angel speaks at the empty tomb following the Resurrection of Jesus saying: “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as He said".

Types of Angels
 Cherubs are described as creatures which have four wings. Cherubim guard the Eden with a sword of fire. This suggests that the author of Genesis was aware of different types of angels. A Cherub is mentioned in Ezekiel 28:13-14, saying that the angel was in the Garden of God.

Ezekiel 28:13-14
13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

It describes the sound of their wings, "like the roar of rushing waters."

Ezekiel 10:5-7 ; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings .

Ezekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have "straight feet" and four wings and four faces.

Ezekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20 ; Ezekiel 10:16

Ezekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be "a wheel in the midst of a wheel" and that the color of the wheels was the color of "Amber" Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there.
 Seraphs (Hebrew for "burning") are depicted as having six wings They are known for singing and praising God. They can shout so loud, they shake the temple.
 Archangels like Gabriel (Gospel of Luke 1:19) are the highest type of angel. They are considered saints in the Catholic church. Unlike angels, humans can overcome sin and repent. Angels cannot repent their sin, because they are already sinless.

When the Bible speaks about the creation of humans in the plural, Judaism sometimes argues that God discussed his decision with the angels. But they make clear, it is God alone who creates humans. God only wanted to discuss with the angels to show that someone in power, should still try to value the opinion of people lower.

However, since angels are held to be spirits (that is, non-material beings), medieval theologians were faced with the problem of how humans could see a non-physical creature. Eventually a theory was put forward that angels must make themselves a body out of the nearest thing to the non-physical, i.e. from air. Hence in his famous poem Aire and Angels, the seventeenth century metaphysical poet John Donne uses this idea to write a cynical comment on women, whose love, he says, is like an angel's body of air, while men's love is like the real thing, the angel itself.

Idea of Guardian angel
From the era of the Romantics onwards, there has developed the widely held belief that everyone has an angel assigned to guard them. This concept is probably based on Jesus' comment in Matthew 18:10 regarding children, though it is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.

In superstitions
Seeing repetitive numbers are thought to be associated with numerology, also referred to as angel numbers. It is believed that angels communicate with humans through repetitive appearances of numbers. Humanity has studied and used numbers since the dawn of time, and no matter what the culture is, there are certain numbers that hold specific value or meaning over other numbers.

Ad hominem
Ad hominem is a Latin word for a type of argument. It is a word often used in rhetoric. Rhetoric is the science of speaking well, and convincing other people of your ideas.

Translated to English, ad hominem means against the person. In other words, when someone makes an ad hominem, they are attacking the person they are arguing against, instead of what they are saying.

The term comes from the Latin word homo, which means human. Hominem is a gender neutral version of the word homo. In ancient Rome it referred to all free men, or in other words, all free human beings.

Ad hominem can be a way to use reputation, rumors and hearsay to change the minds of other people listening. When a social network has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a negative label to them, this can work more often.

It is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument. In courts and in diplomacy ad hominems are not appreciated.

Ad hominems are not wrong every time. For example, when people think that someone can't be trusted, things that they have said previously can be doubted.

What an ad hominem argument looks like
In logic, a proof is something that starts with premises, and goes through a few logical arguments, to reach a conclusion.

Normal (valid) proof
 All humans are mortal.
 Socrates is human.
 Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Ad hominem example
 Person A thinks abortion should be illegal.
 Person A is uneducated and poor.
 Therefore, abortion should not be illegal.

In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.

Native American
| related_groups = 
| footnotes = 
}}

Native Americans (also called Aboriginal Americans, American Indians, Amerindians, or Indigenous peoples of the Americas) are the indigenous peoples and their descendants, who were in the Americas before the Europeans arrived.
Name
The people are sometimes called Indians, but that may be confusing, because it is the same word used for people from India. When Christopher Columbus explored the area, he did not know about the Americas. He was in the Caribbean but thought he was in the East Indies and so he called the people Indians. Today, some think that it is racism to use Indian for a Native American.

There are different Native American tribes, with many different languages. Some tribes were hunter-gatherers who moved from place to place. Others lived in one place and built cities and kingdoms. Many Native Americans died after the European settlers came to the Americas. One reason is that diseases came with the Europeans but were new to the Native Americans. There were also battles with the Europeans. Many native people were hurt, killed, or forced to leave their homes by settlers, who took their lands.

Origins
The ancestors of Native Americans came to the Americas from Asia. Some of them may have come to the Americas 15,000 years ago, when Alaska was connected to Siberia by the Bering land bridge.

The earliest people in the Americas came from Siberia when there was an ice bridge across the Bering Strait. The cold but mainly grassy plain, called Beringia, was a land bridge that connected Siberia with Canada. It is believed that a few thousand people arrived in Beringia from eastern Siberia during the Last Glacial Maximum and that they moved into the Americas sometime after 16,500 years before the present (BP). That would have occurred as the American glaciers blocking the way southward melted but before the land bridge was covered by the sea about 11,000 years BP.

Before the European colonization of the Americas and Russian expansion to the Russian Far East, Beringia was inhabited by the Yupik peoples on both sides of the straits. The culture remains in the region today, with others. In 2012, the governments of Russia and the United States announced a plan to formally establish "a transboundary area of shared Beringian heritage." Among other things, the agreement would establish close ties between the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve and the Cape Krusenstern National Monument in the United States, and Beringia National Park in Russia. Native Americans were divided into many small nations that are called called First Nations in Canada and tribes in the United States.
Culture
The Native American tribes have their own cultures, which can be grouped together by region. For example, the tribes living in Mesoamerica have similar cultures.
Food
Native Americans ate various food depending on where they lived. Native Americans from Mesoamerica introduced vanilla, avocados and chocolate to the world.
Religion
Before Europeans came, the Native Americans practiced many different religions. Each tribe had its own different beliefs. Many Native Americans now practice Christianity, a religion that was brought to the Americas by Europeans. Others, meanwhile, still practice their own religions.
Languages
Native Americans speak over 1000 different languages. Some of these languages had writing systems before Europeans came. Many of these languages are endangered because more people speak European languages and do not teach their children Native American languages.

Music
Native Americans make musical instruments using the things around them.
Art
Native Americans made many different kinds of art.
Today
North America
There are now more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the United States combined. About 51 million more Native Americans live in Latin America. Many Native Americans still speak native languages and have their own cultural practices, and others have adopted parts of American culture. Many Native Americans still face problems with racism.
United States
According to the 2010 United States Census, 0.9% of Americans say that they are Native American, 2.9 million people, and 0.8% of Americans say they are both Native American and something else. They are not evenly spread out through the United States. About a third of the people in Alaska are Native Alaskan. and about a sixth of the people in Oklahoma are Native American.

In the United States, most Native Americans live in cities. About 28% of Native Americans live on Indian reservations. Many Native Americans are poor, and 24% are extremely poor. The history of violence against Native Americans still persists in higher rates of violence against Native Americans than whites.
Mexico
Many Mexicans are of Native American or mestizo ancestry. Mexico has the largest and most diverse Native American population in Latin America.
Canada
In the 2016 census, more than 1.67 million people in Canada identified as Indigenous, making them 4.9 percent of Canada’s population.

Central America
Guatemala
About 40% of the people of Guatemala identify as Native American. Many indigenous groups in the country are descendants of the Maya. Many Native Americans in Guatemala are poor. Many of them have left the country to find better jobs elsewhere.
South America
Bolivia
Most people in Bolivia belong to indigenous groups. Many of them are Aymara and Quechua.
Peru
Peru has a large indigenous population, around 80% of the country's population identifying as indigenous or mestizo.
Indigenous activism
In the later half of the 20th century, many Native Americans protested the unfair treatment that they experienced from the societies in which they lived. Some Native Americans have become famous in politics. For example, an Aymara man. Evo Morales was elected as president of Bolivia in 2005.

Apple
thumb|[[Granny Smith green apples]]

An apple is a sweet, edible fruit that is usually red or green. The tree (Malus spp.) is grown worldwide. The fruit is low-cost, popular, and common all over the earth & taste is fruity. 

The apple tree comes from southern Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Uzbekistan; Turkey; and northwestern part of China. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and in European continent. They were brought to North America by European World Colonial settlers. Apples have Religious and mythological significance in many cultures.:.

Apples are generally grown by grafting, although wild apples grow readily from seed. Apple trees are large if grown from seed, but small if grafted onto roots (rootstock). There are more than 10,000 known variants of apples, with a range of desired characteristics. Different variants are bred for various tastes and uses: cooking, eating raw and cider production are the most common uses. In addition to that, when it comes to food toxicity, the seeds in apples can be fatal, but only if they've been crushed. Apples contain amygdalin, which can release cyanide when digested. Apple seeds contain a chemical that can make cyanide, but the amount is too small to harm people who eat a few seeds. 

Trees and fruit are attacked by fungi, bacteria and pests. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production. 

Worldwide production of apples in 2013 was 90.8 million tonnes. China grew 49% of the total.

Botanical information
The apple tree is a small, leaf-shedding tree that grows up to tall. The apple tree has a broad crown with thick twigs.
The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals. They are 5 to 12 centimetres long and 3–6 centimetres (1.2–2.4 in) wide. It has a sharp top with a soft underside. Blossoms come out in spring at the same time that the leaves begin to bud. The flowers are white. They also have a slightly pink color. They have five petals, and 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres (0.98 to 1.4 in) in diameter. The fruit matures in autumn. It is usually 5 to 9 centimetres (2.0 to 3.5 in) in diameter. There are five carpels arranged in a star in the middle of the fruit. Every carpel has one to three seeds.

Wild ancestors
The wild ancestor of apple trees is Malus sieversii. They grow wild in the mountains of Central Asia in the north of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China, They are being used recently to develop Malus domestica to grow in colder climates. Apples were brought to North America. The first apple orchard on the North American continent was said to be near Boston in 1625. In the 1900s, costly fruit industries, where the apple was a very important species, began developing. Different variants are available for temperate and subtropical climates. One large collection of over 2,100 apple variants is at the National Fruit Collection in England. Most of these variants are grown for eating fresh (dessert apples). However, some are grown simply for cooking or making cider. Cider apples are usually too tart to eat immediately. However, they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.

Most popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Colorful skin, easy shipping, disease resistance, 'Red Delicious' apple shape, and popular flavor are also needed. Modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars. This is because popular tastes in apples have become different. Most North Americans and Europeans enjoy sweet apples. and India.

In the United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple.

Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organizations such as [ Common Ground] teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit.

In North America
Many apples are grown in temperate parts of the United States and Canada. "Washington State currently produces over half the Nation's domestically grown apples and has been the leading apple-growing State since the early 1920s." New York and Michigan are the next two leading states in apple production. "The total reported area dedicated to the crop in the United States is 336,940 acres or 526.47 square miles." 

In many areas where apple growing is important, people have huge celebrations:
 Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival - held five days every spring (May-June) in Nova Scotia
 Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival - held six days every spring in Winchester, Virginia.
 Washington State Apple Blossom Festival - held two weeks every spring (April-May) in Wenatchee, Washington.

Algebra
Algebra (from Arabic: الجبر, transliterated "al-jabr", meaning "completion") is a part of mathematics. It uses variables to represent a value that is not yet known or can be replaced with any value. When an equals sign (=) is used, this is called an equation. A very simple equation using a variable is: 2+3=x. In this example, x=5, or it could also be said that "x equals five". This is called solving for x.

Besides equations, there are inequalities (less than and greater than). A special type of equation is called the function. This is often used in making graphs because it always turns one input into one output.

Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things. Physics, engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time. It is also useful to know in surveying, construction and business, especially accounting.

People who do algebra use the rules of numbers and mathematical operations used on numbers. The simplest are adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. More advanced operations involve exponents, starting with squares and square roots.

Algebra was first used to solve equations and inequalities. Two examples are linear equations (the equation of a straight line, y=mx+b or y=mx+c) and quadratic equations, which has variables that are squared (multiplied by itself, for example: 2\cdot2, 3\cdot3, or x\cdot x).

History
Early forms of algebra were developed by the Babylonians and Greek geometers such as Hero of Alexandria. However the word "algebra" is a Latin form of the Arabic word Al-Jabr ("casting") and comes from a mathematics book Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah, ("Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation") written in the 9th century by a Persian mathematician, Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, who was a Muslim born in Khwarizm in Uzbekistan. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in Baghdad, Iraq through 813-833 CE, and died around 840 CE. The book was brought into Europe and translated into Latin in the 12th century. The book was then given the name "Algebra". (The ending of the mathematician's name, al-Khwarizmi, was changed into a word easier to say in Latin, and became the English word algorithm).

Examples

Here is a simple example of an algebra problem:

Sue has 12 candies, and Ann has 24 candies. They decide to share so that they have the same number of candies. How many candies will each have?

These are the steps you can use to solve the problem:

 To have the same number of candies, Ann has to give some to Sue. Let x represent the number of candies Ann gives to Sue.
 Sue's candies plus x must be the same as Ann's candies minus x. This is written as: 12+x=24-x
 Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives: x=12-x. (What happens on one side of the equal sign must happen on the other side too, for the equation to still be true. So in this case when 12 was subtracted from both sides, there was a middle step of 12+x-12=24-x-12. After a person is comfortable with this, the middle step is not written down.)
 Add x to both sides of the equation. This gives: 2x=12
 Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives x=6. The answer is six. This means that if Ann gives Sue 6 candies, they will have the same number of candies.
 To check this, put 6 back into the original equation wherever x was: 12+6=24-6
 This gives 18=18, which is true. They each now have 18 candies.

With practice, algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way. Problems such as building a freeway, designing a cell phone, or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra.

Writing algebra
As in most parts of mathematics, adding y to z (or y plus z) is written as y+z;

subtracting z from y (or y minus z) is written as y-z;

and dividing y by z (or y over z) is written as y/z or \frac yz.

In algebra, multiplying y by z (or y times z) can be written in 3 different ways: y\cdot z, y(z) or just yz. All of these notations mean the same thing: y times z. The symbol "\times" used in arithmetic is not used in algebra, because it looks too much like the letter x, which is often used as a variable.

When we multiply a number and a variable in algebra, we can simply write the number in front of the letter: 5\cdot y\iff5y. When the number is 1, then it is not written because 1 times any number is that number (1\cdot y=y) and so it is not needed. And when it is 0, we can completely remove the terms, because 0 times any number is zero (0\cdot y=0).

As a side note, you do not have to use the letters x or y in algebra. Variables are just symbols that mean some unknown number or value, so you can use any letter for a variable (except e (Euler's number) and i (Imaginary unit), because these are mathematical constants). x and y are the most common, though.

Functions and Graphs
thumb|Linear equation for y=3x+1
An important part of algebra is the study of functions, since they often appear in equations that we are trying to solve. A function is like a machine you can put a number (or numbers) into and get a certain number (or numbers) out. When using functions, graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations.

A graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true. Usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables. The graph is often a line, and if the line does not bend or go straight up-and-down it can be described by the basic formula y=mx+b. The variable b is the y-intercept of the graph (where the line crosses the vertical axis) and m is the slope or steepness of the line. This formula applies to the coordinates of a graph, where each point on the line is written (x,y).

In some math problems like the equation for a line, there can be more than one variable (x and y in this case). To find points on the line, one variable is changed. The variable that is changed is called the "independent" variable. Then the math is done to make a number. The number that is made is called the "dependent" variable. Most of the time the independent variable is written as x and the dependent variable is written as y, for example, in y=3x+1. This is often put on a graph, using an x axis (going left and right) and a y axis (going up and down). It can also be written in function form: f(x)=3x+1. So in this example, we could put in 5 for x and get y=16. Put in 2 for x would get y=7. And 0 for x would get y=1. So there would be a line going through the points (5,16), (2,7), and (0,1) as seen in the graph to the right.

If x has a power of 1, it is a straight line. If it is squared or some other power, it will be curved. If it uses an inequality ( or >), then usually part of the graph is shaded, either above or below the line.

Rules
In algebra, there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations. These are called the rules of algebra. While these rules may seem senseless or obvious, it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics. Therefore, it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared, before taking them for granted. Before going on to the rules, reflect on two definitions that will be given.
 Opposite: the opposite of a is -a.
 Reciprocal: the reciprocal of a is \bar a.

Commutative property of addition
Commutative means that a function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around. In other words, the order of the terms in an equation does not matter. When two terms (addends) are being added, the commutative property of addition is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives a+b=b+a.

Note that this does not apply for subtraction (i.e. a-b\ne b-a except if a=b).

Commutative property of multiplication
When two terms (factors) are being multiplied, the commutative property of multiplication is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives a\cdot b=b\cdot a.

Note that this does not apply for division (i.e. \frac ab\ne\frac ba, when a\neq0 and b\neq0, except if a=b).

Associative property of addition
Associative refers to the grouping of numbers. The associative property of addition implies that, when adding three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c. Note that this does not hold for subtraction, e.g. 1-(2-3)\neq(1-2)-3 (see distributive property).

Associative property of multiplication
The associative property of multiplication implies that, when multiplying three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives a(bc)=(ab)c. Note that this does not hold for division, e.g. 1/(2/4)\neq(1/2)/4.

Distributive property
The distributive property states that the multiplication of a term by another term can be distributed. For instance: a(b+c)=ab+ac. (Do not confuse this with the associative properties! For instance: a(b+c)\ne(ab)+c.)

Additive identity
Identity refers to the property of a number that it is equal to itself. In other words, there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum. The additive identity property states that any number plus 0 is that number: a+0=a. This also holds for subtraction: a-0=a.

Multiplicative identity
The multiplicative identity property states that any number times 1 is that number: a\cdot1=a. This also holds for division: \frac a1=a.

Additive inverse property
The additive inverse property is somewhat like the inverse of the additive identity. When we add a number and its opposite, the result is 0. Algebraically, it states the following: a+-a=0, which is the same as a-a=0. For example, the additive inverse (or opposite) of 1 is -1.

Multiplicative inverse property
The multiplicative inverse property means that when we multiply a number and its reciprocal, the result is 1. Algebraically, it states the following: a\cdot\bar a=1, which is the same as \frac aa=1. For example, the multiplicative inverse (or reciprocal) of 2 is 1/2. To get the reciprocal of a fraction, switch the numerator and the denominator: the reciprocal of \frac23 is \frac32.

Advanced Algebra
In addition to "elementary algebra", or basic algebra, there are advanced forms of algebra, taught in colleges and universities, such as abstract algebra, linear algebra, and universal algebra. This includes how to use a matrix to solve many linear equations at once. Abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations, going beyond numbers to the more abstract with groups of numbers.

Many math problems are about physics and engineering. In many of these physics problems time is a variable. The letter used for time is t. Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems. Energy is e, force is f, mass is m, acceleration is a and speed of light is sometimes c. This is used in some famous equations, like f=ma and e=mc^2 (although more complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation).

Atom
thumb|A simplified picture of a [[helium atom, with two protons (red), two neutrons (white), and two electrons (blue)|alt=Two red balls and two white balls are in the middle. Two smaller blue balls are on a circle around them.]]

An atom is an extremely small piece of matter. All normal matter – everything that has mass – is made of atoms. This includes solids, liquids, and gases. The atom cannot be broken to parts by chemistry, so people once thought it was the smallest piece of matter that could exist. There are over 100 different kinds of atoms, called chemical elements. Each kind has the same basic structure, but a different number of parts. 

Atoms are very small, but their exact size depends on the type. Atoms are from 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers across. One nanometer is about 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. This makes one atom impossible to see without special tools. Scientists learn how they work by doing experiments.

Atoms are made of three kinds of subatomic particles. These are protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons have much more mass. These are in the middle of the atom, called the nucleus. Lightweight electrons move quickly around them. The electromagnetic force holds the nucleus and electrons together.

Atoms with the same number of protons belong to the same chemical element. Examples of elements are carbon and gold. Atoms with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons, are called isotopes. Usually an atom has the same number of electrons as protons. If an atom has more or less electrons than protons, it is called an ion, and has an electric charge.

Atoms can join by chemical bonds. Many things are made of more than one kind of atom. These are chemical compounds or mixtures. A group of atoms connected by chemical bonds is called a molecule. For example, a water molecule is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The forming or breaking of bonds is a chemical reaction.

Atoms split if the forces inside are too weak to hold them together. This is what causes radioactivity. Atoms can also join to make larger atoms at very high temperatures, such as inside a star. These changes are studied in nuclear physics. Most atoms on Earth are not radioactive. They are rarely made, destroyed, or changed into another kind of atom.

History
The word "atom" comes from the Greek (ἀτόμος) "atomos", which means indivisible or uncuttable. One of the first people to use the word "atom" is the Greek philosopher Democritus, around 400&nbsp;BC. He thought that everything was made of particles called atoms, which could not be divided into smaller pieces. Some Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist philosophers also had ideas like this. Atomic theory was a mostly philosophical subject, with not much scientific investigation or study, until the early 1800s.

In 1777 French chemist Antoine Lavoisier defined the term element as we now use it. He said that an element was any substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry. Any substance which could be broken down was a compound.

thumb|Dalton's drawings of atoms (1808)
In 1803, English philosopher John Dalton suggested that elements were made of tiny, solid balls called atoms. Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass. He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine. In any one compound, the atoms would always combine in the same numbers.

In 1827, British scientist Robert Brown looked at pollen grains in water under his microscope. The pollen grains appeared to be shaking. Brown used Dalton's atomic theory to describe patterns in how they moved. This was called Brownian motion. In 1905 Albert Einstein used mathematics to prove that the pollen particles were being moved by the motion, or heat, of individual water molecules. By doing this, he proved that atoms are real without question.

In 1869, Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev published the first periodic table. The periodic table groups elements by their atomic number (how many protons they have; this is usually the same as the number of electrons). Elements in the same column, or group, usually have similar qualities. For example, helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are all in the same column and are very similar. All these elements are gases that have no color or smell. Also, they cannot combine with other atoms to form compounds. Together they are known as noble gases.

The physicist J.J. Thomson was the first person to discover electrons. This happened while he was working with cathode rays in 1897. He learned they had a negative charge, and the rest of the atom had a positive charge. Thomson made the plum pudding model, which said that an atom was like plum pudding: the dried fruit (electrons) were stuck in a mass of pudding (having a positive charge). 

In 1909, Ernest Rutherford used the Geiger–Marsden experiment to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space, the atomic nucleus. Rutherford took a photo plate and covered it with gold foil. He then shot alpha particles (made of two protons and two neutrons stuck together) at it. Many of the particles went through the gold foil, which proved that atoms are mostly empty space. Electrons are so small and fast-moving that they did not block the particles from going through. Rutherford later discovered protons in the nucleus.

thumb|The [[Bohr model is not completely true, but it is useful for the idea of electron shells. This atom has 28 electrons in three shells.]]
In 1913, Niels Bohr created the Bohr model. This model showed that electrons travel around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits. This was better than the Rutherford model, but it was still not completely true.

In 1925, chemist Frederick Soddy discovered that some elements had more than one kind of atom, called isotopes. Soddy believed that each different isotope of an element has a different mass. To prove this, chemist Francis William Aston built the mass spectrometer, which measures the mass of single atoms. Aston proved that Soddy was right. He also found that the mass of each atom is a whole number times the mass of the proton. This meant that there must be some particles in the nucleus other than protons. In 1932, physicist James Chadwick shot alpha particles at beryllium atoms. He saw that a particle shot out of the beryllium atoms. This particle had no charge, but about the same mass as a proton. He named this particle the neutron.

The best model so far comes from the Schrödinger equation. Schrödinger learned that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus, called the electron cloud. In the electron cloud, it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are. The Schrödinger equation says where an electron is likely to be. This area is called the electron's orbital.

In 1937, German chemist Otto Hahn became the first person to make nuclear fission in a laboratory. He discovered this by chance when shooting neutrons at a uranium atom, hoping to make a new isotope. However, instead of a new isotope, the uranium changed into a barium atom, a smaller atom than uranium. Hahn had "broken" the uranium atom. This was the world's first recorded nuclear fission reaction. This discovery led to the creation of the atomic bomb and nuclear power, where fission happens over and over again, creating a chain reaction.

Later in the 20th century, physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom. Using particle accelerators, they discovered that protons and neutrons were made of other particles, called quarks.

Structure and parts
Parts
thumb|This picture shows how small the nucleus is. The electrons are somewhere in the black cloud.
An atom is made of three main particles: the proton, the neutron, and the electron. Protons and neutrons have nearly the same size and mass (about grams). The mass of an electron is about 1800 times smaller (about grams). Protons have a positive charge, electrons have a negative charge, and neutrons have no charge. Most atoms have no charge. The number of protons (positive) and electrons (negative) are the same, so the charges balance out to zero. However, ions have a different number of electrons than protons, so they have a positive or negative charge.

thumb|250px|A picture showing the main difficulty in [[nuclear fusion: Protons, which have positive charges, repel each other when forced together.]]

The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus stays together or goes through radioactive decay. When there are too many neutrons or protons, the atom tries to make the numbers smaller or more equal by removing the extra particles. It sends out radiation in the form of alpha, beta, or gamma decay. Nuclei can also change in other ways. Nuclear fission is when the nucleus breaks into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy. This release of energy makes nuclear fission useful for making bombs, and electricity in the form of nuclear power.
The other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion, when two nuclei join or fuse to make a larger nucleus. This process requires very high amounts of energy to overcome the electric repulsion between the protons, as they have the same charge. Such high energies are most common in stars like our Sun, which fuses hydrogen for fuel. However, once fusion happens, far more energy is released, because some of the mass becomes energy.

The energy needed to break a nucleus into protons and neutrons is called its nuclear binding energy. This energy can be converted to mass, as stated by Einstein's famous formula E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc2. Medium-sized nuclei, such as iron-56 and nickel-62, have the highest binding energy per proton or neutron. They will probably not go through fission or fusion, because they cannot release energy in this way. Very small and very large atoms have low binding energy, so they are most willing to go through fission or fusion.

Electrons

Electrons orbit, or travel around, the nucleus. They are called the atom's electron cloud. They are attracted to the nucleus because of the electromagnetic force. Electrons have a negative charge, and the nucleus always has a positive charge, so they attract each other.

The Bohr model shows that some electrons are farther from the nucleus than others in different levels. These are called electron shells. Only the electrons in the outer shell can make chemical bonds. The number of electrons in the outer shell determines whether the atom is stable or which atoms it will bond with in a chemical reaction. If an atom has only one shell, it needs two electrons to be complete. Otherwise, the outer shell needs eight electrons to be complete.

The Bohr model is important because it has the idea of energy levels. The electrons in each shell have a certain amount of energy. Shells that are farther from the nucleus have more energy. When a small burst of energy called a photon hits an electron, the electron can jump into a higher-energy shell. This photon must carry exactly the right amount of energy to bring the electron to the new energy level. A photon is a burst of light, and the amount of energy determines the color of light. So each kind of atom will absorb certain colors of light, called the absorption spectrum. An electron can also send out, or emit, a photon, and fall into a lower energy shell. For the same reason, the atom will only send out certain colors of light, called the emission spectrum.

The complete picture is more complicated. Unlike the Earth moving around the Sun, electrons do not move in a circle. We cannot know the exact place of an electron. We only know the probability, or chance, that it will be in any place. Each electron is part of an orbital, which describes where it is likely to be. No more than two electrons can be in one orbital; these two electrons have different spin.

thumb|Shapes of different orbitals around an atom

For each shell, numbered 1, 2, 3, and so on, there may be a number of different orbitals. These have different shapes, or point in different directions. Each orbital can be described by its three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number is the electron shell number. The azimuthal quantum number is represented by a letter: s, p, d, or f. Depending on the principal and azimuthal quantum numbers, the electron can have more or less energy. There is also a magnetic quantum number, but it does not usually affect the energy level. As more electrons are added, they join orbitals in order from lowest to highest energy. This order starts as follows: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d. For example, a chlorine atom has 17 electrons. So, it will have:
2 electrons in the 1s orbital
2 electrons in the 2s orbital
6 electrons in the 2p orbitals
2 electrons in the 3s orbital
5 electrons in the 3p orbitals
In other words, it has 2 electrons in the first shell, 8 in the second shell, and 7 in the third shell. 

Properties
Atomic number
thumb|450px|The [[periodic table organizes all known chemical elements.]]
The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. Atoms of the same element have the same atomic number. For example, all carbon atoms have six protons, so the atomic number of carbon is six. Today, 118 elements are known. Depending on how the number is counted, 90 to 94 elements exist naturally on earth. All elements above number 94 have only been made by humans. These elements are organized on the periodic table.

Atomic mass and weight
Because protons and neutrons have nearly the same mass, and the mass of electrons is very small, we can call the number of protons and neutrons in an atom its mass number. Most elements have several isotopes with different mass numbers. To name an isotope, we use the name of the element, followed by its mass number. So an atom with six protons and seven neutrons is called carbon-13.

Sometimes, we need a more exact measurement. The exact mass of an atom is called its atomic mass. This is usually measured with the atomic mass unit (amu), also called the dalton. One amu is exactly 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, which is grams. Hydrogen-1 has a mass of about 1 amu. The heaviest atom known, oganesson, has a mass of about 294 amu, or grams.

How atoms interact
When atoms are far apart, they attract each other. This attraction is stronger for some kinds of atoms than others. At the same time, the heat, or kinetic energy, of atoms makes them always move. If the attraction is strong enough, relative to the amount of heat, atoms will form a solid. If the attraction is weaker, they will form a liquid, and if it is even weaker, they will form a gas. 

thumb|[[Graphite is made of carbon atoms in layers. Covalent bonds hold each layer together. The attraction between different layers is a Van der Waals force.]]
Chemical bonds are the strongest kinds of attraction between atoms. The movement of electrons explains all chemical bonds.
Atoms usually bond with each other in a way that fills or empties their outer electron shell. The most reactive elements have an almost full or almost empty outer shell. Atoms with a full outer shell, called noble gases, do not usually form bonds.

There are three main kinds of bonds: ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and metallic bonds.

In an ionic bond, one atom gives electrons to another atom. Each atom becomes an ion: an atom or group of atoms with a positive or negative charge. The positive ion (which has lost electrons) is called a cation; it is usually a metal. The negative ion (which has gained electrons) is called an anion; it is usually a nonmetal. Ionic bonding usually results in a regular network, or crystal, of ions held together.

In a covalent bond, two atoms share electrons. This usually happens when both atoms are nonmetals. Covalent bonds often form molecules, ranging in size from two atoms to many more. They can also form large networks, such as glass or graphite. The number of bonds that an atom makes (its valency) is usually the number of electrons needed to fill its outer electron shell.

In a metallic bond, electrons travel freely between many metal atoms. Any number of atoms can bond this way. Metals conduct electric current because electric charge can easily flow through them. Atoms in metals can move past each other, so it is easy to bend, stretch, and change the shape of metals.

All atoms attract each other by Van der Waals forces. These forces are weaker than chemical bonds. They are caused when electrons move to one side of an atom. This movement gives a negative charge to that side. It also gives a positive charge to the other side. When two atoms line up their sides with negative and positive charges, they will attract.

Although atoms are mostly empty space, they cannot pass through each other. When two atoms are very close, their electron clouds will repel each other by the electromagnetic force.

Magnetism
To understand how magnets work, we can look at the properties of the atom. Any magnet has a north and south pole, and a certain strength. The direction and strength of a magnet, together, are called its magnetic moment. Every electron also has a magnetic moment, like a tiny magnet. This comes from the electron's spin and its orbit around the nucleus. The magnetic moments for the electrons add up to a magnetic moment for the whole atom. This tells us how atoms act in a magnetic field. 

Every electron has one of two opposite spins. We can think of one as turning to the right, and the other as turning to the left. If every electron is paired with an electron with the opposite spin in the same orbital, the magnetic moments will cancel out to zero. Atoms like this are called diamagnetic. They are only weakly repelled by a magnetic field.

However, if some electrons are not paired, the atom will have a lasting magnetic moment: it will be paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. When atoms are paramagnetic, the magnetic moment of each atom points in a random direction. They are weakly attracted to a magnetic field. When atoms are ferromagnetic, the magnetic moments of nearby atoms act on each other. They point in the same direction. This means that the whole object is a magnet, and it can point in the direction of a magnetic field. Ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel, are strongly attracted to a magnetic field.

Radioactive decay

thumb|An alpha particle shoots out of a nucleus.

Some elements, and many isotopes, have what is called an unstable nucleus. This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together, or it has too many protons or neutrons. When a nucleus is unstable, it has to eliminate the excess mass of particles. It does this through radiation. An atom that does this is called radioactive. Unstable atoms emit radiation until they lose enough particles in the nucleus to become stable. All atoms above atomic number 82 (82 protons, lead) are radioactive.

thumb|The nuclei in black are stable. All others are [[radioactive. The left axis is the number of protons, and the bottom axis is the number of neutrons.]]

There are three main kinds of radioactive decay: alpha, beta, and gamma.
 Alpha decay is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons. This is a helium-4 nucleus. The result is an element with an atomic number of two less than before. So, for example, if a uranium atom (atomic number 92) went through alpha decay, it would become thorium (atomic number 90). Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to lose some mass.
 Beta decay is when a neutron turns into a proton, or a proton turns into a neutron. In the first case, the atom shoots out an electron. In the second case, it shoots out a positron (like an electron but with a positive charge). The result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before. Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons or too many neutrons.
 Gamma decay is when an atom shoots out a gamma ray, or wave. It happens when there is a change in the energy of the nucleus. This is usually after a nucleus has gone through alpha or beta decay. There is no change in the atom's mass, or atomic number, only in the stored energy inside the nucleus, in the form of particle spin.

Every radioactive element or isotope has a half-life. This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay into a different isotope or element.

Creation of atoms
Nearly all the hydrogen atoms in the Universe, most of the helium atoms, and some of the lithium atoms were made soon after the Big Bang. Even today, about 90% of all atoms in the Universe are hydrogen.

All other atoms come from nuclear fusion in stars, or sometimes from cosmic rays that hit atoms. At the start of their life, all stars fuse hydrogen to make helium. The least massive stars, red dwarfs, are expected to stop there. All other stars will then fuse helium to make carbon and oxygen. In stars like the Sun, the temperature and pressure are too low to make larger atoms. But more massive stars continue fusion, until they create iron (atomic number 26) or nickel (atomic number 28). Atoms can also grow larger when neutrons or protons hit them. This could happen inside stars or in supernovae. Most atoms on Earth were made by a star that existed before the Sun.

People make very large atoms by smashing together smaller atoms in particle accelerators. However, these atoms often decay very quickly. Oganesson (element 118) has a half-life of 0.00089 seconds. Even larger atoms may be created in the future.

Astronomy
thumb|The [[Milky Way as seen from La Silla Observatory]]

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial bodies. It is a major branch of space science. Stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and nebulae are studied, as are supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. Astronomy includes the development, physics, chemistry, meteorology and movement of celestial bodies. The big questions are the structure and development of the universe.

Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. The patterns of stars in the night sky were called constellations in Late Latin. They used the positions of the stars to navigate, and to find when was the best time to plant crops.

Astrophysics is an important part of astronomy. A related subject, cosmology, is concerned with studying the universe as a whole, and the way the universe changed over time. Astronomy is not the same as astrology, a belief that the motion of the stars and the planets may affect human lives.

There are two main types of astronomy, observational and theoretical astronomy. Observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy explains what we see. It predicts what might happen. Observations show whether the predictions work. The main work of astronomy is to explain puzzling features of the Universe. For many years the most important issue was the motions of planets. Many other topics are now studied.

Day-time astronomy is possible but could be harmful. The Sun, is our biggest star, better describes as a big all of light and observing directly is dangerous. It is too bright, and can burn your eyes and can cause permanent blindness. To look at the Sun you need proper shields and equipment. Some other individual bright stars and planets can be seen during daylight hours through a telescope or a powerful pair of binoculars.

History of astronomy

Ancient history
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars. They made maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and calendars to work out the time of year. Early civilisations such as the Maya people and the Ancient Egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions. They also began to think about the place of Earth in the universe. For a long time people thought Earth was the center of the universe, and that the planets, the stars and the sun went around it. This is known as geocentrism. Astronomy is from the Greek astron (ἄστρον) meaning "star" and nomos (nόμος) meaning "law")

Ancient Greeks tried to explain the motions of the Sun and stars by taking measurements. A mathematician named Eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the Earth and proved that the Earth is a sphere. A theory by another mathematician named Aristarchus was, that the Sun is the center and the Earth is moving around it. This is known as heliocentrism. Only a few people thought it was right. The rest continued to believe in the geocentric model. Most of the names of constellations and stars come from Greeks of that time.

Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the Middle Ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth. They also learned from the ancients by translating Greek books into Arabic.

Renaissance to modern era
thumb|upright|Drawings of [[the Moon by Galileo. His drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look at the Moon.]]

During the renaissance a priest named Nicolaus Copernicus thought, from looking at the way the planets moved, that the Earth was not the center of everything. Based on previous works, he said that the Earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the Sun. This brought back the old idea of heliocentrism. Galileo Galilei built his own telescopes, and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time. He agreed with Copernicus. The Catholic Church thought Galileo was wrong. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. Heliocentric ideas were soon improved by Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, who invented the theory of gravity.

After Galileo, people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes. They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae.

Modern era
The 20th century after 1920 saw important changes in astronomy.

In the early 1920s it began to be accepted that the galaxy in which we live, the Milky Way, is not the only galaxy. The existence of other galaxies was settled by Edwin Hubble, who identified the Andromeda nebula as a different galaxy. It was also Hubble who proved that the universe was expanding. There were many other galaxies at large distances and they are receding, moving away from our galaxy. That was completely unexpected.

In 1931, Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.

The opening of this new window on the Universe saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example pulsars, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that (so it was thought) it implied an artificial source.

The period after World War II saw more observatories. Large and accurate telescopes were built and operated at good observing sites, usually by governments. For example, Bernard Lovell began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military radar equipment. By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at Mauna Kea in Hawaii, a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.

The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry. This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites.

Space telescopes gave access, for the first time in history, to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere. The X-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet light and parts of the infra-red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched. As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.

From 1970s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Discoveries
Discoveries broadly come in two types: bodies and phenomena. Bodies are things in the Universe, whether it is a planet like our Earth, or a galaxy like our Milky Way. Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.

Bodies
For convenience, this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found: those found around stars are solar bodies, those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies.

 Asteroids
 Comets

Diffuse Objects:

 Clusters

Compact Stars:

 Galaxies

 Superclusters

Phenomena
Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly. These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a "burst" of energy. They include:
 Supernovas
 Novas

Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way. The name periodic comes from period, which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle. Periodic phenomena include:
 Pulsars
 Variable stars

Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago. The signal from these events bounce around the Universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity. In this way, it is "noise", the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy. The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions. The principal astronomical example is: cosmic background radiation.

Methods
Instruments
 Telescopes are the main tool of observing. They take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area. This is like making your eyes very big and powerful. Astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim. Telescopes make objects look bigger, closer, brighter.
 Spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light. This shows what something is made of.
 Many telescopes are in satellites. They are space observatories. The Earth’s atmosphere blocks some parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but special telescopes above the atmosphere can detect that radiation.
 Radio astronomy uses radio telescopes. Aperture synthesis combines smaller telescopes to create a phased array, which works like a telescope as big as the distance between the smaller telescopes.

Techniques
There are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens. Light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured, normally by a human eye or a camera. For very dim sources, there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen. One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration (which is like longer exposures in photography).

Integration
Astronomical sources do not move much: only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens. As light particles reach the camera over time, they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background, until it can be seen.

Telescopes at most observatories (and satellite instruments) can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens, making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures. Also, images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours, days or even months. In the digital era, digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer, which overlays the images after correcting for movement.

Adaptive optics
Adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something, to see it better.

Data analysis
Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it. The observation is first stored as data. This data then has various techniques used to analyse it.

Fourier analysis
Fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation (over a length of time) is changing periodically (changes like a wave). If so, it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern, and find many things including new planets.

Subfields of astronomy
Pulsars pulse regularly in radio waves. These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low-mass X-ray binary. It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found. Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.

This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy.

Solar astronomy

Solar astronomy is the study of the Sun. The Sun is the closest star to Earth at around 92 million (92,000,000) miles away. It is the easiest to observe in detail. Observing the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed. Changes in the Sun can affect the weather and climate on Earth. A stream of charged particles called the Solar wind is constantly sent off from the Sun. The Solar wind hitting the Earth's magnetic field causes the northern lights.

Stellar astronomy
Stellar astronomy, sometimes stellar astrophysics is the scientific study of stars, their formation, evolution and fate (stellar evolution). In the most basic sense, Stellar Astronomy attempts to answer the questions to the universe's most common phenomena — stars. Heavily relating with Galactic and Planetary Astronomy.

220x124px|thumb|right|Messier 041,a star system in the constellation Canis Major

Planetary astronomy
Planetary astronomy is the study of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars. The planets of our own Solar System have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as Cassini-Huygens (Saturn) and the Voyager 1 and 2.

Galactic astronomy
Galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies. Studying distant galaxies is a good way of learning about our own galaxy, as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe. Galactic astronomers try to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed by using different types of telescopes and computer simulations.

Gravitational wave astronomy
Gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the Universe in the gravitational wave spectrum. So far, all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape, which include white dwarves, neutron stars and black holes. Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly, the impact of gravitational wave astronomy has been limited.

Unsolved problems
Great discoveries also produce unsolved problems. This is just a short-list:
 Dark matter and dark energy: what are they?
 Ultimate fate of the Universe? What will it be?
 Why is lithium 4 times rarer than predicted?
 Origin of supermassive black holes.
 The source of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
 The existence of Extraterrestrial life.

Architecture
thumb|right|350px|[[Gothic Revival architecture for Santuario de Las Lajas, Ipiales, Colombia]]
thumb|250px|The [[Parthenon in Greece one of the seven wonders of the ancient world]]

Architecture is the process of designing structures and buildings. It uses both art and engineering. Examples include houses, churches, hotels, office buildings, roads, tunnels and bridges. 

Architecture is the profession of an architect. Usually, a person must study at an institution of higher education (university) to become an architect. There were architects long before there was higher education. They learnt by being an apprentice to an established architect. 

Architecture can do small designs, such as for a garage, or large designs, such as for a whole new town. The capital cities of Brasília, and Canberra were designed. Architects often work with structural engineers to make structurally sound buildings.

History
thumb|Romanesque groin vault
In the past, people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great civilizations like the Ancient Egyptians built large temples and structures, like the Great Pyramids of Giza. The Ancient Greeks and Romans made what we now call "Classical Architecture". The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the arch from the Etruscans, who copied it from the Mesopotamians. 

thumb|A simpler building, in [[Hungary]]
Classical architecture was formal, and it always obeyed laws. It used symmetry, which really means balance, and it used proportion between shapes. The Golden Mean was a rule which said, (to put it simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times as long as the short side. There are many 'laws' in classical architecture, like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are often used today. However, today more notice is taken of specific facts, such as what wind speeds occur once or twice in a century. Several bridges have blown down because that was not properly taken into consideration.

In some parts of the world, like India, the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles occur in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.

Architects in Western Europe in the Middle Ages made Romanesque architecture, then Gothic architecture. Gothic buildings have tall, pointed windows and arches. Many churches have Gothic architecture. Castles were also built at this time. In Eastern Europe, churches usually had domes. People added their own ideas and decoration to the Classical Architecture of the past. The Renaissance brought a return to classical ideas. 
thumb|left|Architecture can have many styles, such as the curved [[Guggenheim Museum in New York City]]
In the late 18th century with the Industrial Revolution, people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many factories and mills were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the Victorian era, architects like George Fowler Jones and Decimus Burton still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in Ulm, Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse. This happened to the Beauvais Cathedral, which was never completed. 
thumb|New technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the [[Willis Tower in Chicago]]

Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, steel became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build. An example is the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them skyscrapers. This new technology has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings.

Modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called "post-modern".

Many of the world's greatest structures were built by modern-day architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright; Sir Hugh Casson; Norman Foster; I. M. Pei; Adrian Smith; Edward Durell Stone; Frank Gehry; Fazlur Khan; Gottfried Böhm; and Bruce Graham.

Anatomy
thumb|Anatomy of the human head

Anatomy is the study of the bodies of people and other animals. Anatomy is the study of the inside of the body and outside the body. Anatomy notes the position and structure of organs such as muscles, glands and bones. A person who studies anatomy is an anatomist. 

The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BC when Egyptians began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system.

For long periods the dissection of deceased people was forbidden, and correct ideas about human anatomy was a long time coming.

Academic human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools and teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching and research. Gross anatomy studies parts of the body that are big enough to see. Micro-anatomy studies smaller parts.

Body systems
There are different organ systems, such as the cardiovascular system, also known as the circulatory system (the system that gets blood around the body), the muscular system (the system that contains muscles), the nervous system (the system that controls the nerves, and the brain) and the skeleton (the bones).

Anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are similar basic medical sciences.

Asteroid
thumb|A photo of asteroid (253) Mathilde taken by [[NEAR]]

An asteroid is a minor planet that orbits within the inner solar system. It is a small object in the Solar System that travels around the Sun. It is like a planet but smaller. They range from very small (smaller than a car) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have an asteroid moon.

The name "asteroid" means "like a star" in the ancient Greek language. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the Sun. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own light. Because of this, some people think "asteroids" is not a good name, and think that the name "planetoid" ("like a planet") would be a better name.

Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the Solar System. These rocks were too small to come together to make a planet. Some are made of carbon or metal. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various asteroid spectral types including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).

Most asteroids in our Solar System are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called Near-Earth asteroids. Some scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off all the dinosaurs and caused some of the other extinction events.

Media told in 2025, about the chemical substances that were (found on, or) sampled from asteroid Bennu: "traces of brine" and "all five nucleobases that make up DNA and RNA: adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil". The sample was taken in 2020, and the space capsule with sample, landed in the United States in 2023.

History
Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. He called it Ceres, and it is the biggest object in the asteroid belt. Others, like Juno, Pallas, and Vesta were found later. In the 1850s, so many had been found that they were numbered by a Minor planet designation starting with 1 Ceres. Today, astronomers using computerized telescopes find thousands of asteroids every month. Asteroid impact prediction is one of their purposes.

Afghanistan, officially the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is a country in Asia. It borders Pakistan in the south and east (border with India is disputed), Iran in the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north, and China in the far northeast. Kabul is the capital city.

Afghanistan is currently governed by the Taliban, after the collapse of the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on 15 August 2021.

The country is around in size. There are 40.976 million people in Afghanistan. There are about 3 million Afghan refugees (people who had to leave the country) in Pakistan and Iran. In 2011 Kabul, had about 3,691,400 people living in it.

United Nations Human Rights Council decided in October 2021 to appoint an independent expert, known as a United Nations special rapporteur on Afghanistan, to find out about violations carried out by the Taliban and others who are now part of a big conflict.

Economy
The economy does not have growth (as April 2024), of that kind that is called GDP growth, according to Worldbank.org. In regard to the mining industry: In 2024, Chinese engineers broke ground for a mine; "The deposit is estimated to [... have] 11.5 million tons of copper ore".

Geography
left|thumb|Snow-capped Koh-i-Baba mountains in [[Bamyan Province of Afghanistan.]]
Afghanistan has many mountains. The mountains are called the Hindu Kush and Himalayas. The tallest mountain in Afghanistan is Mount Nowshak. There are plains (which have soil that is good for growing plants) and foothills. Parts of the country are also dry, especially the Registan Desert. Afghanistan has snow and glaciers in the mountains. Amu Darya is the big water stream, or river.

The country has a lot of a valuable stone called lapis lazuli, which was used to decorate the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun.

Climate
Afghanistan has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. Having no water sometimes causes problems for farmers. Sandstorms happen a lot in the desert.

Plants and animals
left|thumb|150px|Endangered [[snow leopards live in the cold Hindu Kush]]
Southern Afghanistan does not have many plants because it is dry. There are more plants where there is more water. Mountains have forests of pine and fir, cedar, oak, walnut, alder, and ash trees.

Afghanistan's wild animals live in the mountains. There are wolves, foxes, jackals, bears, and wild goats, gazelles, wild dogs, camels, and wild cats such as the snow leopard in the country. The birds are falcons, eagles and vultures. The Rhesus Macaque and the red flying squirrel are also in Afghanistan.

Many years of war, hunting, and years of no water have killed animals in Afghanistan. There used to be tigers in Afghanistan, but now there aren't any. Bears and wolves are almost gone. Tajiks are the second-largest ethnic group, making up about one-fifth of the population. Before the 20th century, Tajiks were called Sarts and some come from Iranian peoples. Most Pashtuns are also related to the Iranian peoples. Some Pashtuns and Tajiks marry each other but at the same time they are rivals. The third-largest group are the Hazaras. They are native to the Hazaristan area in central Afghanistan. The country's other groups include the Uzbek, Aimaq, Turkmen, Nuristani, Baloch, and Pashayi. Both are Indo-European languages from the Iranian languages sub-family. They are usually written with the Arabic alphabet. Uzbek and Turkmen are widely spoken in the north and Nuristani and Pashai are spoken in the east. Afghanistan is near what used to be the Silk Road. The peoples of Afghanistan helped develop major world religions, traded and exchanged many products, and sometimes controlled politics and culture in Asia.

Prehistory
thumb|upright|[[Zoroaster, the founder of Zoroastrianism, lived in Bactria, an ancient land in the north of today's Afghanistan.]]
Archaeologists digging a cave in Badakhshan discovered that people lived in the country as early as 100,000 years ago. They found the skull of a Neanderthal, or early human, as well as tools from about 30,000 years ago. In other parts of Afghanistan, archaeologists uncovered pottery and tools that are 4,000 to 11,000 years old—evidence that Afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals.
left|thumb|150px|A Stone Female Figurine, known as Bactrian Princess, from [[Bactria, north of Afghanistan, about 4,000 years ago]]

Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the Hindu Kush as early as 7000&nbsp;B.C. These people may have grown rich off the lapis lazuli they found along riverbeds, which they traded to early city sites to the west, across the Iranian plateau and Mesopotamia. As farms and villages grew these ancient people started irrigation (digging ditches for water so it flows to crops) that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains. This civilization (advanced state of organization) is today called BMAC (Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex), or the "Oxus civilization".

The Oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the Indus Valley during the period between 2200 and 1800&nbsp;B.C. These people, who were the ancestors of the Indo-Aryans, used the term "Aryan" to identify their ethnicity, culture, and religion. Scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people; the Avesta of Iranic peoples and the Vedas of Indo-Aryans.

Zoroaster, the founder of the Zoroastrian religion, the world's earliest monotheistic religion, (meaning a religion believing in one god) lived in the area (somewhere north of today's Afghanistan), around 1000&nbsp;B.C.

Ancient history
thumb|Names of territories during the [[Caliphate in 750 CE. Khorasan was part of Persia (in yellowish).]]
Before the middle of the sixth century BCE, Afghanistan was held by the Medes. Then the Achaemenids took over control of the land and made it part of the Persian empire. Alexander the great defeated and conquered the Persian Empire in 330 BCE. He founded some cities in the area. The people used Macedonian culture and language. After Alexander, Seleucids, Mauryas, Greco-Bactrians, Scythians, Kushans, Parthians, Guptas and Sassanians ruled the area.

Kushans spread Buddhism from India in the 1st century BCE, and Buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the Islamic conquest in the 7th century CE.

The Buddhas of Bamiyan were giant statues, a reminder of Buddhism in Afghanistan. They were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. There were international protests. The Taliban believe that the ancient statues were un-Islamic and that they had a right to destroy them.

Medieval history

Arabs introduced Islam in the 7th century and slowly began spreading the new religion. In the 9th and 10th centuries, many local Islamic dynasties rose to power inside Afghanistan. One of the earliest was the Tahirids, whose kingdom included Balkh and Herat; they established independence from the Abbasids in 820. The Tahirids were succeeded in about 867 by the Saffarids of Zaranj in western Afghanistan. Local princes in the north soon became feudatories of the powerful Samanids, who ruled from Bukhara. From 872 to 999, north of the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan enjoyed a golden age under Samanid rule.

In the 10th century, the local Ghaznavids turned Ghazni into their capital and firmly established Islam throughout all areas of Afghanistan, except the Kafiristan region in the northeast. Mahmud of Ghazni, a great Ghaznavid sultan, conquered the Multan and Punjab region, and carried raids into the heart of India. Mohammed bin Abdul Jabbar Utbi, a historian from the 10th century, wrote that thousands of "Afghans" were in the Ghaznavid army. The Ghaznavid dynasty was replaced by the Ghorids of Ghor in the late 12th century, who reconquered Ghaznavid territory in the name of Islam and ruled it until 1206. The Ghorid army also included ethnic Afghans.

All the major cities of modern Afghanistan were centers of science and culture in the past. The New Persian literature arose and flourished in the area. The early Persian poets such as Rudaki were from what is now Afghanistan. Moreover, Ferdowsi, the author of Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, and Rumi, the famous Sufi poet, were also from here. It has produced scientists such as Avicenna, Al-Farabi, Al-Biruni, Omar Khayyám, Al-Khwarizmi, and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in areas such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, physics, geography, and geology. It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating Mongol invasion in the 13th century.

Timur, the Turkic conqueror, took over in the end of the 14th century and began to rebuild cities in this region. Timur's successors, the Timurids (1405–1507), were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of Herat with fine buildings. Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity.

Between south of the Hindu Kush and the Indus River (today's Pakistan) was the native land of the Afghan tribes. They called this land "Afghanistan" (meaning "land of the Afghans"). The Afghans ruled the rich northern Indian subcontinent with their capital at Delhi. From the 16th to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was disputed between the Safavids of Isfahan and the Mughals of Agra who had replaced the Lodi and Suri Afghan rulers in India. The Safavids and Mughals occasionally oppressed the native Afghans but at the same time the Afghans used each empire to punish the other. In 1709, the Hotaki Afghans rose to power and completely defeated the Persian Empire. Then they marched towards the Mughals of India and defeated them with the help of the Afsharid forces under Nader Shah Afshar.

In 1747, after Nader Shah of Persia was killed, a great leader named Ahmad Shah Durrani united all the different Muslim tribes and established the Afghan Empire (Durrani Empire). He is considered the founding father of the modern state of Afghanistan

Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a country in South America. Argentina is the second-largest country in South America and the eighth-largest country in the world.

Spanish is the most spoken language, and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. There are minorities speaking Italian, German, English, Quechua and even Welsh in Patagonia.

In eastern Argentina is Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, it is also one of the largest cities in the world. In order by number of people, the largest cities in Argentina are Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario, Mendoza, La Plata, Tucumán, Mar del Plata, Salta, Santa Fe, Neuquén and Bahía Blanca.

Argentina is between the Andes mountain range in the west and the southern Atlantic Ocean in the east and south. It is bordered by Paraguay and Bolivia in the north, Brazil and Uruguay in the northeast, and Chile in the west and south. It also claims the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Most citizens of the Argentine Republic are descendants of immigrants from Europe. They are united by citizenship and not necessarily by ethnicity. Most Argentinians embrace both their ethnic origins and Argentinian nationality.

History
The name Argentina comes from the Latin argentum (silver) as the Spanish conquistadors believed the area had silver. In the Americas (South and North), Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).

The oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the Patagonia (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the Inca Empire conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the Guaraní developed a culture based on yuca and sweet potato however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.

Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentinians are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.

Argentina declared independent from Spain in 1816, and achieved it in a War led by José de San Martín in 1818. Many immigrants from Europe came to the country. By the 1920s it was the 7th wealthiest country in the world, but it began a decline after this. In the 1940s, following the "infamous decade" where the country's politics were not stable, Juan Peron came to power. Peron was one of the most important people in the country's history and many politicians today call themselves Peronist. Peron was forced out of power in 1955. After spending years in exile he returned to power in the 1970s.

In 1976, the country was falling into chaos, and the military took power. This was not the first time the military had done this. Leading the new government was Jorge Rafael Videla. Videla was one of history's most brutal dictators. Thousands of people disappeared or were killed during his time as president. Videla retired in 1980.

One of his successors was another general turned dictator, Leopoldo Galtieri. By the time Galtieri was in office in 1981 the dictatorship became unpopular. To stir up support, Galtieri ordered an invasion of the Falkland Islands, starting the Falklands War. Argentina lost the war, and soon the country fell into chaos again. Galtieri was removed from power and eventually democracy was restored. Galtieri and Videla would be charged with "crimes against humanity" because of the mass murder and other crimes that they ordered as president.

In the early 21st century Argentina is one of the most important countries in Latin America, though it still has many problems. It has a large economy and is influential in the "southern cone" of South America and a member of the G20 developing nations.

In December 2023, Argentina was the invitee country but it did not joined to the BRICS bloc.

Politics
Argentina is a federal republic. The people of Argentina vote for a President to rule them and Senators and Deputies to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is Javier Milei since December 2023.

Geography

260px|thumb|left|alt=Map of Argentina|Map of Argentina

Argentina is almost 3,700&nbsp;km long from north to south, and 1,400&nbsp;km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the Pampas in the central part of the country, Patagonia in the southern part down to Tierra del Fuego; and the Andes mountain range along the western border with Chile, with the highest point in the province of Mendoza. Cerro Aconcagua, at 6,960 metres (22,834 ft), is the Americas' highest mountain.

The most important rivers include the River Plate, Paraguay, Bermejo, Colorado, Uruguay and the largest river, the Paraná. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team.

See List of cities in Argentina for the many places people live in Argentina.

Other information
The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from Spain, Italy, Russia, France, Germany , Arabs other Europeans countries and Mestizo representing more than 90% of the total population of the country. More than 300,000 Roma gypsies live in Argentina. Since the 1990s, Romanian, Brazilian and Colombian gypsies arrived in Argentina.

Football or soccer is the most popular sport, although the national sport of the country is Pato. Argentina has a number of highly ranked Polo players. Field hockey (for women) rugby and golf are also favorites.

Argentina is a Christian country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are Roman Catholic. Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well.

Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.

Austria (, ; ), officially the&nbsp;Republic of Austria ( ), is a country in Central Europe. Around Austria are the countries of Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. 

The people in Austria speak German, a few also speak Hungarian, Slovenian and Croatian. The capital of Austria is Vienna (Wien).

History
Austria is more than 1000 years old. Its history can be followed to the 9th century. At that time, the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name Ostarrichi is first written in an official document from 996. Since then, that word developed into the Modern German word Österreich, which literally means "Eastern Empire."

Ancient times
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic Age, the time of the Neanderthals. They left works of art such as the Venus of Willendorf. In the Neolithic Age people, lived there to dig for mineral resources, especially copper. Ötzi, a mummy found in a glacier between Austria and Italy, is from that time.

During the Bronze Age, people built larger settlements and fortresses, especially where there were mineral resources. Salt mining began near Hallstatt. At that time, Celts began to form the first states.

The Romans
thumb|center|Map of Austria during Roman rule, divided into the three provinces, Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia
The Romans came 15 BC to Austria and made the Celtic Regnum Noricum to a Roman province. What is now Austria, was part of three provinces, Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia. The border in the north was the Danube.

Holy Roman Empire
From the Early Middle Ages, the area of modern-day Austria was part of the Holy Roman Empire. The capital of the Holy Roman Empire was the Austrian city of Vienna. The Austrian Habsburg family became the rulers of the empire, and the son of the Holy Roman Emperor held the title of Archduke of Austria.

In 1806, France defeated the Holy Roman Empire and replaced it with the Confederation of the Rhine. Former Holy Roman Emperor Francis&nbsp;II became the Emperor of the new Austrian Empire, which later became Austria-Hungary.

Modern history
In 1869, the first postcards were sent from Austria. Within three months, almost 3 million cards had been sold. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Austria was , on 19 February 1932 at Grünloch doline.

Politics
thumb|State flag of Austria

History
The Hittites and Hayasa-Azzi may have played a significant role in the ethnicity of Armenians. It has an ancient cultural heritage. One of the earliest Armenian kingdoms such as Urartu was established in 861 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of Armenia. The Kingdom of Armenia reached its height under Tigranes the Great in the 1st century BC and became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official state religion in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. The official date of state adoption of Christianity is 301.

Foreign invasion
Between the 16th century and 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia came under the rule of the Ottoman and Iranian empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the Russian Empire, while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule.

20th century
During World War I, Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically 
exterminated in the Armenian Genocide, perpetrated by Ottoman Young Turks. Around 1.5 million people were slaughtered and many more deported. In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Empire ceased to exist and all non-Russian countries declared their independence. This led to the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, and in 1922 became a founding member of the Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into full Union republics. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

21st century

Administrative divisions
Armenia is divided into ten provinces, with the city of Yerevan having special administrative status as the country's capital. The chief executive in each of the ten provinces is the marzpet (marz governor), appointed by the government of Armenia. In Yerevan, the chief executive is the mayor, appointed by the president.

, Armenia includes 915 communities, of which 49 are considered urban and 866 are considered rural.

Culture
Armenia is a majority Christian country, with European and some wider Eurasian cultural influences. The Republic of Armenia recognizes the Armenian Apostolic Church, the world's oldest national church, as the country's primary religious establishment. The unique Armenian alphabet was invented by Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD. Armenia also has a minority of Yazidis who settled in the country after fleeing persecution and have long established themselves into the wider Armenian society and have been integrated into the country. They speak both Armenian and their native Kurmanji.

Armenia is a member of the Council of Europe, the Eurasian Economic Union and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Armenia supports the de facto independent Republic of Artsakh, which was proclaimed in 1991.

Archaeology
thumb|300 px|A [[Ancient Rome|Roman theatre in Alexandria, Egypt]]

Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of the human past. It looks at remains and objects left by the people who lived long ago. These remains may include old coins, tools, buildings, and inscriptions. Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.

Fieldwork
thumb|A 12th century BC (Bronze Age) hoard from Stockheim in Germany

When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging in the ground. As settlements (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings get buried. Usually, this is a natural process. A typical student project is to leave an object in a place where there is nothing going on. It will get covered rather quickly, because wind, water and plants will bury it. Sometimes buildings are deliberately buried to make way for new buildings. Ancient Rome, for example, is now up to 40&nbsp;feet (12&nbsp;metres) below the present city. This process of natural or man-made burial is why archaeological fieldwork involves digging, and is expensive and takes a long time.

When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to a base. Short term, the base is often on or near the site. Longer term, the results will usually go to a university or museum. Everything is written down on paper or entered into a computer. Gradually, they build up a picture of what happened long ago. Archaeologists publish their research so others can understand what they learned.

Fields of interest
Archaeologists do not all study the same topics. They have specialties. Some fields of interest include Ancient Egypt (these specialists are called Egyptologists), Ancient China, or the Vikings. Archaeologists study every civilization that is known, especially the ones where there is no written history. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the beginning of human life in Africa, or study World War II. Marine archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea.

Subdisciplines
There are many different ways of doing archaeology. these depend on the methods used, the things studied, and the environment. Some of these subdisciplines overlap with each other.

Marine archaeology
Archaeology relating to oceans, seas and lakes is usually done underwater. It includes the study of sunken ships and submerged coastlines. "Maritime archaeology" is a part of this subdivision. It refers to the archaeological investigation of past ships and seafaring. A famous example of maritime archaeology is the recovery and restoration of the ship Vasa.

Ice-patch archaeology
When a glacier melts, thingss that were captured in it can be seen. The recovery and study of these objects is called "ice-patch archaeology". A famous example is Ötzi the Iceman.

Historical archaeology
Historical archaeology deals with places, things, and issues from the past or present at or related to sites with written records or oral traditions. Or it can be defined as "the archaeological investigation of any past culture that has developed a literate tradition." A prominent example of historical archaeology is the work done at Colonial Williamsburg.

Industrial archaeology
This relatively new branch of archaeology consists of "the systematic study of structures and artefacts as a means of enlarging our understanding of the industrial past."

Archaeozoology
Archaeozoology, or zooarchaeology, is the study of the relationships between humans and animals in the archaeological record. This includes the study of bones, feathers, teeth and other body parts as well as their interpretation.

Paleoethnobotany
Paleoethnobotany (also spelled palaeoethnobotany), or archaeobotany, is the study of past human-plant relations through the recovery and analysis of plant remains from the past, usually from archaeological sites. People who do this can be archaeologists, botanists, or chemists.

Extraterrestrial archaeology
Any archaeology done outside of Earth is extraterrestrial archaeology. For example, people do archaeological work on satellites and on the Moon. The first extraterrestrial archaeology was done by a NASA astronaut, Kayla Barron, on the International Space Station: "On 14 January 2022, she used bright yellow adhesive tape to mark out the corners of 1 sq m (10.7 sq ft) on a science rack in a module of the ISS – like an archaeological trench – and repeated the process in five other locations, ranging from the galley to the toilet." 

Experimental archaeology
This field involves attempts at replicating the actions and conditions of ancient cultures. Good examples are Butser Ancient Farm and Overton Down.

Sites
In many countries, governments and other groups of people protect important archaeological sites so they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.

Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people who are building often don't have a lot of time. As soon as the archaeologists are done with their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are very important.

Application
The word application has several uses.

In medicine, 'application' means putting some drug or ointment usually on the skin where it is absorbed into the human body.

In computer software, an application is a type of program which is designed for a particular function. Example: word processing. It is most used to mean a Mobile app.
 
In business or government, an application is a (usually paper) form filled out and handed in by a person seeking a privilege from a state or company, such as work, credit, some type of license or permit, or a place to live.

At work, generally engineering, when dealing with certain materials or objects, an "application" is a purpose that material or object can be used for. Wood and steel have many applications.

Animals (or Metazoa) are living creatures with many cells that make up the kingdom Animalia. 

Animals get their energy from other living things. Usually, they eat them or are parasites. Animals, plants, fungi, and some other living things have complex cells, so they are grouped together as eukaryotes.

The study of animals is called zoology. The study of ancient life is called palaeontology.

Most animals are mobile, meaning they can move around. Animals take in oxygen, and give out carbon dioxide. This cellular respiration is part of their metabolism (chemical working). In both these ways they are different from plants. Also, the cells of animals have different cell membranes to other eukaryotes like plants and fungi. 

Plants are also multicellular eukaryotic organisms, but live by using light, water and basic elements to make their tissues.

Grouping animals
There are many different types of animals. The common animals most people know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. When biologists look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They use this to group the animals in a biological classification. Several million species may exist, but biologists have only identified about one million.

Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups: the invertebrates and the vertebrates. Vertebrates have a backbone, or spine; invertebrates do not. Vertebrates are the only group to have an adaptive immune system, which may be partly responsible for their size and success.

Vertebrates are:
Fish (or 'fishes': both ways are correct)
Amphibia
Reptiles
Birds
Mammals

Some invertebrates are:
Insects
Spiders
Crustacea
Molluscs (like a snail or squid)
worms
jellyfish

Life styles
The animal mode of nutrition is called heterotrophic because they get their food from other living organisms. Some animals eat only plants; they are called herbivores. Other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores. Some animals get their energy from photosynthetic protists that live inside them. 

The environments animals live in vary greatly. By the process of evolution, animals adapt to the habitats they live in. A fish is adapted to its life in water and a spider is adapted to a life catching and eating insects. A mammal living on the savannahs of East Africa lives quite a different life from a dolphin or porpoise catching fish in the sea.

The fossil record of animals goes back about 600 million years to the Ediacaran period, or somewhat earlier. During the whole of this long time, animals have been constantly evolving, so that the animals alive on Earth today are very different from those on the edges of the sea-floor in the Ediacaran.

Acceleration
Acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity changes. Acceleration is the change of velocity divided by the change of time. Acceleration is a vector, and therefore includes both a size and a direction. Acceleration is also a change in speed and direction. There is:

Speed (a scalar quantity) (uses no direction)

 Distance is how far you traveled.
 Time is how long it took you to travel.
 Speed is how fast you are moving - Speed = Distance / Time 

Velocity (a vector quantity) (uses a direction)

 Displacement is how much your position has changed in what direction.
 Velocity is how quickly your position is changing and in what direction.
 Velocity = Displacement / Time 

The measurement of how fast acceleration changes is called jerk. 

Examples
 An object was moving north at 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and is now moving north at 17 meters per second. The object has accelerated. 
 An apple is falling. It starts falling at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple is moving at 9.8 meters per second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down at 19.6 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again.
 Jane is walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Jane's velocity does not change. Jane's acceleration is zero. 
 Tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom turns and walks south at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom has had a nonzero acceleration. 
 Sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally slows down. After, Sally walks east at 1.5 kilometers per hour. Sally has had a nonzero acceleration.
 Acceleration due to gravity

Finding acceleration

Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object. Acceleration \mathbf can be found by using:

\mathbf = {\mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0} \over { t_1 - t_0 }}

where
\mathbf{v_0} Is the velocity at the start
\mathbf{v_1} Is the velocity at the end
t_0 Is the time at the start
t_1 Is the time at the end

Sometimes the change in velocity \mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0} is written as Δ\mathbf{v}. Sometimes the change in time { t_1 - t_0 } is written as Δt.

In difficult situations, the acceleration can be calculated using mathematics: in calculus, acceleration is the derivative of the velocity (concerning time),\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}.

Units of measurement
Acceleration has its units of measurement. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2).

Other words
Acceleration can be positive or negative. When the acceleration is negative (but the velocity does not change direction), it is sometimes called deceleration. For example, when a car brakes it decelerates. Physicists usually only use the word "acceleration".

Newton's second law of motion
Newton's laws of motion are rules for how things move. These rules are called "laws of motion". Isaac Newton is the scientist who first wrote down the main laws of motion.
According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the force something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's mass (the amount of "stuff" the object is made from or how "heavy" it is).
The formula of Newton's Second Law of Motion is \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a},
where \mathbf{a} is the acceleration, \mathbf{F} is the force, and m the mass. 
This formula is very well-known, and it is very important in physics. Newton's Second Law of Motion, in short "Newton's Second Law", is often one of the first things that physics students learn.

Deceleration
Deceleration is negative or backwards acceleration. This means that something slows down instead of speeding up. For example, when a car brakes, it is decelerating.

Black pudding
thumb|Bury Black Puddings
Black pudding is an English name for zwarte pudding. It is food made by cooking down the blood of any mammal (usually pigs or cattle) with meat, fat or filler until it is thick enough to congeal (become firm or solid) when cooled.

Types of black pudding
thumb|German Blutwurst
In Great Britain, blood sausage is called "black pudding". The ingredients include pig's blood, suet, bread, barley and oatmeal. Bury is well known for them. The most common kind of German Blutwurst is made from fatty pork meat, beef blood and filler such as barley. Though already cooked and "ready to eat" it is usually served warm.

Other kinds of blood sausage include boudin noir (France), boudin rouge (Creole and Cajun) and morcilla (Spain).

History
A legend says that blood sausage was invented in a bet between two Bavarian butchers drunk on the alcoholic drink absinthe during the 14th century. Homer's Odyssey from Ancient Greece says that "As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted...".

Boot device
A boot device is used to start a computer. It is named after a boot which fits on the foot. The word bootstrap is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better. It comes from the English phrase "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps."

Before a computer can operate normally, it must have operating system instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions. A boot device loads the operating system into the memory of the computer. 

Devices that can boot a computer are usually boot disks or boot drives (normally a hard drive or Solid State Drive, but can be a floppy disk, flash drive or a CD). Some network computers use boot chips that get the operating system over a network. Web phones also use such chips to identify the user to the mobile phone network. Boot card standards may let many users boot kiosk computers with full privacy and access to all application software they own. There are also boot boards or boot add-in cards that are more permanent than boot cards.

Some people refer to the boot device as just a boot and non-boot devices as data devices, although it is not the computer but the operating system that cares about the difference between these.

Origin
The boot in boot device is the same as booting (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.

Boot
thumb|Rain boots
alt=|thumb|200x200px|Combat leather boots 
A boot is a type of footwear that protects the foot and ankle. Boots are higher and larger than shoes and sandals. Some boots are high enough to protect the calves (lower part of the leg) as well. Some boots are held on with bootstraps or bootlaces. Some also have spats or gaiters to keep water out. Most have a very strong boot sole, the bottom part of a boot.

Types of boots
 Rain boots (or rubber boots) are made from rubber or plastic. Rain boots protect a person's feet from water and rain. People who work on fishing boats and farmers wear rubber boots to keep their feet dry. People who work in chemical factories wear rubber boots to protect their feet from dangerous chemicals.

 Winter boots are boots that keep a person's feet warm in cold weather. People in cold countries such as Canada and Sweden wear winter boots during the cold season. Winter boots can be made from many different materials, such as leather, fabric, or plastic. Winter boots are insulated with wool or fur to keep the feet warm. Most winter boots also keep people's feet dry.

 Work boots (or "construction boots") are designed for people who work in construction or factory jobs. Work boots often have a steel toe cover to protect the person's toes. Work boots are usually made of strong leather, to protect the person's foot from sharp objects or dangerous chemicals. Some work boots have a flat piece of steel in the sole to protect the foot from sharp nails. Many countries require construction workers to wear work boots when they are on a construction site.

 Fashion boots are boots that are worn for style than for protection. Usually the term is used for women's boots. These kind of boots come in many heights, where the top ends at the ankle, the knee, or the thigh. The ones that are tall are usually closed by a zipper or can stretch for putting it on easily. This is because using shoe laces would take time for the taller types.

Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy is a legal process which happens when a person or an organization does not have enough money to pay all of its debts. Legally they are insolvent.

Where it is a person who cannot pay their debts, the person's creditors may ask the court to appoint a trustee in bankruptcy. This is a professional accountant who is appointed by the court, to take control of the bankrupt person's assets. Some assets are protected by law, but the trustee in bankruptcy will sell off all of the other assets and use the money to pay as much of that person's debts as possible. After the process is complete the person is discharged from bankruptcy, and the person is free from any further liability to pay those claims, but normally that person will be limited in their ability to borrow money again because their credit rating will be damaged.

Where it is an organisation which cannot pay its debts, the creditors may ask the court to appoint a liquidator. The liquidator does a very similar job to the trustee in bankruptcy except that there are no assets which are protected so the liquidator can sell everything. Once all of the assets of the organisation have been sold, the organisation is then dissolved and no longer exists. Organisations do not get discharged from bankruptcy in the same way that a living person does.

Insolvency or bankruptcy
People often confuse the terms bankruptcy and insolvency, and sometimes they use one word when they really mean the other. Insolvency usually just means that a someone does not have enough money to pay their debts or (sometimes) that the total amount of their debts is worth more than the total amount of their assets. Bankruptcy is a formal legal process in front of the courts. Although the two terms are connected, just because a person is insolvent does not necessarily mean that they will go into bankruptcy.

Alternatives to bankruptcy
Many countries have alternatives to bankruptcy to try and allow people and businesses to try and avoid the bankruptcy process.

In various countries, individual people can try and reach individual voluntary arrangements (or IVAs) with their creditors. This means that the creditors agree to take less money to discharge their debts. There are similar processes for companies and other organisations, and they go by various different names in different countries, but in many countries they are called schemes of arrangement.

Bankruptcy protection
In many countries a company or business can ask the courts for bankruptcy protection to try and protect the business so that the creditors cannot destroy all of the physical capital and goodwill by breaking it apart and moving it away. The aim of this is to provide more time for the business to reorganise itself and to work out a new deal between the owners and the people with whom the business owes money. In many countries this is called going into administration.

However, not all countries have bankruptcy protection laws for businesses.

Debt slavery
Often a creditor threatens a debtor with debt slavery in many parts of the world. In some cases the debtor does not know that they have a right to go bankrupt. This is a human rights problem in some countries. It is also called liquidation bankruptcy because some of a debtor's property may be sold (liquidated) to satisfy creditors. This usually makes a company stop doing business. Employees often lose their jobs when company files for chapter 7.

Chapter 11
Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a complicated type of bankruptcy that reorganizes the debtor's finances, usually reducing the amount of debt owed and changing debt repayment terms. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy case allows a business to keep running while it finds ways to reduce and arrange payment of its debts.

Almost all Chapter 11 bankruptcies are filed by businesses. Ordinary people do not usually file Chapter 11 bankruptcy, because a Chapter 13 bankruptcy will almost always be cheaper and easier for them.

Chapter 13
Chapter 13 is the most popular form of bankruptcy in the United States for ordinary people. In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy some of your debts may be forgiven (discharged), but you will have to pay back a portion of your debt. The debt repayment plan is supervised by the bankruptcy court and usually lasts for three to five years. Businesses cannot file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

Other bankruptcy chapters

Less common forms of bankruptcy may be filed under Chapter 9 and Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code.

 Chapter 9 bankruptcy allows municipalities, smaller units of government such as cities and towns, to restructure their debts.
 Chapter 12 bankruptcy is a special type of bankruptcy for family farms and fishermen. It combines elements of Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy to allow smaller farms and fishing businesses to stay open while they restructure their debts.

Breakfast sausage
Breakfast sausage is a type of fresh pork sausage made from seasoned ground meat mixed with bread crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as British or Italian-style sausages.

History of breakfast sausages
The journey of breakfast sausages began centuries ago in Europe, with each European country adding its unique twist. For instance, Germany is known for its variety of wursts, while Italian sausages often feature fennel and garlic. This evolution reflects changes in societal norms and eating habits, transitioning from a means of preservation to a convenient breakfast option.

Using breakfast sausages
Breakfast sausages are not cured or smoked like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen). Uncooked sausages should be stored in the refrigerator or the freezer. Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot soapy water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked. 

They are usually fried or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at breakfast, often with cooked eggs, pancakes, and toasted bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as "toad in the hole" a cooked batter dish.

Preparation and Cooking
Cooking breakfast sausages to perfection is an art. Frying in a pan over medium heat brings out rich flavors, while baking offers a healthier alternative with minimal attention. Grilling imparts a unique smoky flavor. Regardless of the method, the internal temperature should reach 160°F (71°C) to ensure they are cooked through.

Types of breakfast sausages
Different types made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can now be found. There are also vegetarian types that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.

Nutritional Information
Breakfast sausages are a good protein source but can be high in saturated fat and sodium. Leaner versions are available, and for those looking for plant-based alternatives, vegetarian sausages offer similar textures and flavors but are lower in fat and cholesterol-free.

Cultural Variations
Breakfast sausages are a staple in many cultures. In the US, they are often paired with pancakes and eggs. In the UK, they are a key part of the 'full English breakfast.' German Bratwurst and Italian sausages with fennel and garlic are examples of how different regions have embraced and adapted breakfast sausages.

Recipes and Serving Suggestions
Creative ways to incorporate breakfast sausages into meals include Sausage and Egg Muffin Cups, Sausage Breakfast Casseroles, and Sausage and Vegetable Skillets. These recipes demonstrate the versatility of breakfast sausages in various cuisines.

Modern Developments and Trends
Recent trends in breakfast sausages include the rise of plant-based options, ethically sourced meats, global flavors, and healthier ingredients. This reflects changing consumer preferences towards healthier and more diverse food choices.

Beekeeping
thumb|200px|Bees on a comb.

Beekeeping or apiculture is the farming of honeybees.

Uses
The keeping of bees is usually, and has been in the past, for honey. That is becoming less true. Instead, it is more used for crop pollination and other products. These are wax and propolis.

There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest. She lays all the eggs, which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons. However, they do not control the hive.

Types of beekeeping
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit. Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a hobby. Urban beekeeping is a growing trend, and some have found that "city bees" are actually healthier than "rural bees" because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity.

Threats
Colony Collapse Disorder is a growing problem, along with mites.

British English is the dialect of English that is spoken in the United Kingdom. It is different in some ways from other types of English such as American English. British English is widely spoken in most countries that were once part of the British Empire.

Use in other countries
American English is used in the United States. In Canada, the accent sounds very similar to American English, but Canadian English has a few differences. Canada has mixed the spelling rules of American and British English to form its own spelling rules.

Most members of the Commonwealth of Nations learn British English, and American English is often learnt in the Americas, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The United Kingdom and Ireland use British layout keyboards, and Australia, South Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the United States use American layout keyboards. In Continental Europe, English as a second language is sometimes taught in American English except in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, where British English is taught.

Pronunciation
In the United Kingdom, the spelling remains the same, but the pronunciation varies in the local dialects. For example, a person from a place near London may not pronounce the "r" the same as a person from Scotland. Across the country, the accent is different. Liverpool people may speak with a "Scouse" accent, and Birmingham people speak with a "Brummie" accent. 

In London, the "Cockney" accent was once common but it is almost never heard today. All regional accents became less extreme in the 20th century. That is generally attributed to the arrival of radio and television. Another factor is the increased mobility of people. A similar process has been noted in the United States, where regional differences are much less noticeable than they used to be.

Spelling

There are many words that sound the same in both American and British English but have different spellings. British English often has more traditional ways of spelling words than American English. Many British English rules are also used in other countries. Most of those countries are members of the Commonwealth of Nations.

Vocabulary
In British English, "dock" refers to the water in the space between two "piers" or "wharfs". In American English, the "pier" or "wharf" could be called a "dock", and the water between would be a "slip".

Being
Being is also a present tense part of to be

The word being means a living person or animal. ‘Human being’ means the same as ’person’. Men, women, and children are human beings.

Some people write stories or make movies about beings from other planets. Most religions talk about supernatural beings, for example spirits, angels, devils, gods, or God.

thumb|Beijing in China

Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China. The city used to be known as Peking. It is in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Having more that 21 million residents, it is one of the most populous capital cities.

The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China. Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work. Nearly 15 million people live there. Beijing hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 2008, and the Winter Olympic Games in 2022. It is the only city that has hosted both.

Beijing is well known for its ancient history. Since the Jin Dynasty, Beijing has been the capital of several dynasties (especially the later ones), including the Yuan, Ming, and Qing. There are many places of historic interest in Beijing.

Name

The Mandarin Chinese name of the city is Běijīng, which means "The Northern Capital". It got this name when the Yongle Emperor of the Ming family of rulers moved most of his government from Nanjing ("The Southern Capital") in the early 1400s. In Chinese, Beijing's name is written }}.}} Today, people spell it "Beijing" because they use the pinyin way of spelling, which shows what the name should sound like in Mandarin. People used to spell it "Peking" because that was the spelling used by some of the first people from Europe to visit the Ming and write home about it; the Jesuits' work was made popular by their French brother Du Halde.I, p.135]]}} It then became the official Chinese Postal Map spelling around 1900 and continued to be used until pinyin became more popular.

Beijing was also known as Beiping ("City of Northern Peace") between 1928 and 1949, when the Nationalists moved the Chinese capital to Nanjing and Chongqing.

History
The center of Beijing was settled in the 1st millennium BC. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (燕, Yān) set up their capital where Beijing is today. They called it Ji (蓟, Jì). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place.

Beijing became more important again in the 10th century, when the Jin dynasty set its capital there. This city was destroyed by Mongol forces in 1215. Then in 1267, Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it "Great Capital" (大都, Dàdū), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When Kublai Khan the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital.

The Yuan Dynasty, Ming Dynasty and Qing dynasty all made Beijing their capital. When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up, the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing. When the People's Republic of China seized power, Beijing became the capital of China again.

In 1989, there were protests in Tian'anmen Square because some people wanted democracy.
 221 BC: Yan State capital
 1271: Yuan Dynasty national capital
 1402: Ming Dynasty capital
 1644: Qing Dynasty capital
 1912: Republic of China capital

Education
Beijing is the education center of People's Republic of China. More than 500 famous universities of China are in Beijing. They also include 5 of the top universities: Peking University, Tsinghua University, China People University, Beijing Normal University, and Beihang University. Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language. The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect, so over 70% foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies.

Berry
thumb| Several types of common "berries". None is a berry by botanical definition:The blueberry is a [[false berry, blackberries are aggregate fruit, and strawberries are accessory fruit. ]]

The word berry is used for many different kinds of small fruits that have many seeds and can be used as food. Some examples are raspberry, strawberry, sutberry, lingonberry and blueberry.

When botanists talk about berries, they mean a simple fruit produced from a single ovary. They sometimes call this true berry, to distinguish it from false berries. By that statement of how words are used, grapes or tomatoes are true berries.

The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the pericarp which can be taken as food. The flowers of these plants have an upper ovary with one or more carpels. The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary.

Berries are small, sweet, bright colored fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more animals towards them and spread their seeds.

Types of berries
thumb| Four fruits that are true berries, shown larger than they are. [[Clockwise from right: grapes, persimmon, red gooseberries, red currants (top). ]]

Some fruits that are called berries in English are not true berries by the use of words above. These include raspberries, strawberry, sutberry, blackberries, cranberries, and boysenberries. Some true berries do not have berry in their name. These include tomatoes, bananas, eggplants, guavas, pomegranates and chillies. Pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, oranges and lemons are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names (pepo for pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons, or hesperidium for oranges and lemons).

Some fruits are "botanical berries", meaning that scientists who study plants call them berries. But not all of these are the types of fruit that we usually call berries. Also, some of the fruits we usually call berries, are not "botanical berries".

Beard
thumb|220px|Some kinds of beards

A beard is the hair growing on the lower part of a man's face.

The hair that grows on the upper lip of some men is a mustache. When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin, it is called a soul patch. Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men shave part or all of their beards, or cut their beard so it does not get very long.

Some animals also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a beard.

Black
right|thumbIn light, black is the absence of all color. It is a shade. In painting, however, black pigment is the combination of all colors. In heraldry, black is called "sable". It is the opposite of white. No color can have the same level of dark pigmentation without turning itself into black. It appears as a dark shade that can reflect light into the rainbow.

Black in science and related

A way to create black objects is to mix pigments. A pigment works by reflecting only the color of other colored objects because they absorb more light.

Meaning of black

Black is associated with a range of concepts, from power, elegance, formality, safety, birth, and male to death, crime, female, evil and mystery. Black is the darkest color there is. Black, along with gray and white, is a neutral color. This means that it is not a hot color or a cool color.

Black is a color seen with fear and the unknown. It can have a bad meaning (blackbird, black bunny) or a good meaning ('in the black', 'black is beautiful'). Black can stand for strength and boldness. It can be a formal, elegant and high-class color (black tie, black Mercedes).

Bubonic plague is the best-known form of the disease plague caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The name bubonic plague is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the lymphatic system.

The plague was spread by fleas on rats. This method of spreading disease is called a zoonosis.

If the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims in three to seven days. The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the Black Death, which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the Middle Ages.

Symptoms of this disease include coughing, fever, and black spots on the skin.

Different kinds of the same disease
There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of flea, that lives on rats. Then there is an incubation period which can last from a few hours to about seven days.

Septicemic plague
Sepsis happens when the bacterium enters the blood and makes it form tiny clots.

Pneumonic plague
This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days.

The abortive form
This is the most harmless form. It will result in a small fever. After that, the victim's body produces antibodies that protect against all forms of the disease for a long time.

History
The first recorded epidemic was in the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), It was called the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived after long treatment. The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50&nbsp;million people (two centuries of recurrence).

During the 1300s, this epidemic struck parts of Asia, North Africa, and Europe. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike catastrophes that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. Giovanni Boccaccio, an Italian writer of the time, described it: "This scourge had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers abandoned brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children".

thumb|upright=1.4|Distribution of plague infected animals 1998

Local outbreaks of the plague are grouped into three plague pandemics, whereby the respective start and end dates and the assignment of some outbreaks to either pandemic are still subject to discussion. The pandemics were:
 the first plague pandemic from 541 to ~750, spreading from Egypt to the Mediterranean (starting with the Plague of Justinian) and northwestern Europe
 the second plague pandemic from ~1331 to ~1855, spreading from Central Asia to the Mediterranean and Europe (starting with the Black Death), and probably also to China In 2017 the countries with the most cases include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. Fleas are the vector. The flea gets the bacteria as they feed on an infected animal, usually a rodent. Several proteins then work to keep the bacteria in the flea's digestive tract. This is important for the survival of Y. pestis in fleas.

Modern history
In the 20th century, some countries did research on the bacteria that causes bubonic plague, in order to use it for biological warfare.

Samples of this bacteria are carefully controlled. There is much paranoia (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a US expert in this organism was charged in October 2003 by the FBI with various crimes. This happened after he said he lost samples of Yersinia pestis. This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them.

Biology

Biology is the science that studies life, living things, and the evolution of life. Living things include animals, plants, fungi (such as mushrooms), and microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea.

The term 'biology' is relatively modern. It was introduced in 1799 by a physician, Thomas Beddoes. It comes from the Greek word βίος (bios), "life", and the suffix -λογία (logia), "study of".

People who study biology are called biologists. Biology looks at how animals and other living things behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment. It has existed as a science for about 200 years, and before that it was called "natural history". Biology has many research fields and branches. Like all sciences, biology uses the scientific method. This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves.

Biology attempts to answer questions such as:

 "What are the characteristics of this living thing?" (comparative anatomy)
 "How do the parts work?" (physiology)
 "How should we group living things?" (classification, taxonomy)
 "What does this living thing do?" (behaviour, growth)
 "How does inheritance work?" (genetics)
 "What is the history of life?" (palaeontology)
 "How do living things relate to their environment?" (ecology)

Modern biology is influenced by evolution, which answers the question: "How has the living world come to be as it is?"

History

The earliest roots of science, including medicine, go back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their ideas influenced ancient Greek natural philosophy. Greek thinkers like Aristotle (384–322 BCE) added a lot to early biology. He studied causes in nature and the variety of living things. His student, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants.

In the medieval Islamic world, several scholars wrote about biology. Al-Jahiz (781–869) and Al-Dīnawarī (828–896) wrote about animals and plants. Rhazes (865–925) studied the body and how it works. Islamic scholars, working from Greek ideas, studied medicine deeply. They also followed Aristotle’s ideas about nature.

Biology grew quickly when Anton van Leeuwenhoek greatly improved the microscope. Scientists then discovered sperm cells, bacteria, and many tiny living things. Jan Swammerdam’s work led to interest in insects and new methods of studying tiny organisms. Better microscopes strongly changed how people thought about life.

In the early 1800s, scientists saw that cells were central to life. In 1838, Schleiden and Schwann said that (1) all living things are made of cells and (2) each cell shows the signs of life. They did not believe that (3) all cells come from other cells; they still thought cells could appear on their own. Later, Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow proved that new cells come from existing cells. By the 1860s, most scientists accepted all three ideas, which became known as cell theory.

At the same time, natural historians focused on naming and grouping living things. Carl Linnaeus published a basic system in 1735 and gave scientific names to species in the 1750s. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, believed species were not fixed and could change, and even suggested that different species might share ancestors.

In 1842, Charles Darwin wrote the first draft of On the Origin of Species. Earlier, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had offered one of the first full theories of evolution. Darwin built a stronger theory of evolution through natural selection. He used ideas from geography, geology, and population studies, along with his own observations. Alfred Russel Wallace reached similar conclusions on his own.

Modern genetics started with Gregor Mendel’s work in 1865. He explained how traits are passed from parents to offspring. People did not fully understand his work until the early 1900s. Then, evolution and genetics were combined into the modern synthesis.

In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase showed that DNA is the part of chromosomes that carries genes. Scientists began to study small organisms like viruses and bacteria. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick discovered that DNA has a double-helix shape. After this, biology expanded into molecular genetics. Scientists cracked the genetic code, showing how DNA uses codons to build proteins. This work was done by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley, and Marshall Warren Nirenberg. In 1990, the Human Genome Project began to map all human genes.

Chemical basis
Atoms and molecules
All living things are made of chemical elements. Most of their mass (about 96%) comes from oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Other elements like calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium make up almost all the rest. These elements can join together to form compounds, such as water, which is essential for life. 

Ecosystems
An ecosystem is made up of living things (like plants, animals, and microbes) and nonliving things (like water, air, sunlight, temperature, soil, and acidity) that exist together in one place. The living and nonliving parts are connected through the flow of energy and the recycling of nutrients. Energy from the sun enters the ecosystem when plants use photosynthesis to make food. Animals eat plants and other animals, which moves energy and matter through the system. Animals also affect how much plant and microbe life there is. When living things die, decomposers break down their remains. This process releases carbon back into the air and changes the nutrients in dead material into forms that plants and microbes can use again.

Populations
A population is a group of living things of the same species that live in one area and reproduce over many generations. You can estimate how big a population is by multiplying how many organisms are in a certain space (population density) by the size of the area or volume. An environment’s carrying capacity is the largest number of individuals of a species that the environment can support. This depends on things like food, water, space, and shelter. The carrying capacity can change if the environment changes—for example, if resources become harder to find or more expensive to use. For humans, new technologies—like those from the Green Revolution—have helped increase how many people Earth can support. This growth has proved wrong some older predictions that human populations would soon decline, such as those made by Thomas Malthus in the 1700s.]]

A community is a group of different populations of species that live in the same place at the same time. A biological interaction is how two organisms in a community affect one another. These organisms can be from the same species (intraspecific) or from different species (interspecific). Some interactions are short-term, like pollination or hunting. Others are long-term and can strongly affect how species evolve.

A long-term relationship between species is called a symbiosis. Symbiosis can be:
 Mutualism – both species benefit
 Competition – both are harmed

Every species in a community is either a consumer, a resource, or both. These roles form food chains and food webs.

Food webs have different trophic levels (feeding levels):
 Primary producers (autotrophs) are at the lowest level. They include plants and algae that use energy and nonliving materials to make food.
 Heterotrophs are organisms that get energy by breaking down organic material from other organisms. There are different types:
 Primary consumers (herbivores) eat plants.

Biosphere
In the world ecosystem (the biosphere), matter is found in different parts that interact with each other. These parts can be living (biotic) or nonliving (abiotic), and they can be easy to use (accessible) or hard to use (inaccessible) depending on where they are and what form they take.

For example:
 The matter in land plants (terrestrial autotrophs) is living and accessible to other organisms.
 The matter in rocks and minerals is nonliving and not accessible.

A biogeochemical cycle is the path that a specific element of matter takes as it moves through the living parts of Earth (the biosphere) and the nonliving parts (the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere).

There are biogeochemical cycles for nitrogen, carbon, and water.

Conservation
Conservation biology is the study of protecting Earth’s biodiversity. Its goal is to save species, their habitats, and ecosystems from disappearing too quickly and to keep natural interactions between living things intact.

It looks at what causes biodiversity to be lost, what helps it survive, and how it can be restored. It also studies how evolution continues to create diversity in genes, populations, species, and ecosystems. Scientists are concerned because estimates suggest that up to half of all species on Earth could disappear in the next 50 years. Losing biodiversity can lead to problems like poverty, hunger, and big changes in how life evolves on Earth. Biodiversity is important because it keeps ecosystems working. Ecosystems provide many services that humans rely on. Conservation biologists study how biodiversity loss and species extinction affect our ability to live well. Governments, organizations, and citizens are taking action through conservation plans. These plans include research, monitoring, and education programs, helping protect biodiversity from local to global levels.

Belgium (officially the Kingdom of Belgium; , , ) is a country in Western Europe. Its capital, Brussels, is the home of many organizations including the European Union and NATO. Belgium is bordered by the Netherlands in the north, Germany to the east, Luxembourg to the southeast and France to the south.

Belgium has an area of . Around 11.6 million people live in Belgium. It is a founding member of the European Union and is home to its headquarters.

Regions
There are three regions in Belgium. The regions are mainly based on language and culture. Flanders and Wallonia are both split up into five provinces each.
 Flanders is the name of the northern half of Belgium, just south of the Netherlands. Most of the people in this region, called the Flemish people, speak Dutch.
 Wallonia is the name of the southern half of Belgium, just north of France. Here, most of the people, the Walloons, speak French. There is a small part of Wallonia next to the border with Germany where the people speak German.
 The Brussels-Capital Region, where the capital of Brussels is found, is in the middle of the country, but surrounded by Flanders on all sides. It used to be Dutch-speaking, but today French is mostly spoken, with some Dutch.
The population is about 60% Dutch-speaking, 39% French-speaking, and 1% German-speaking (the so-called Deutschbelgier). To look after all these groups, Belgium has a complex system of government with highly autonomous regions.

History
thumb|left|The [[Seventeen Provinces (orange, brown and yellow areas) and the Bishopric of Liège (green)]]
The name 'Belgium' comes from Gallia Belgica. This was a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul. Before Roman invasion in 100&nbsp;BC, the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples, lived there. The Germanic Frankish tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the Merovingian kings. A slow shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to change into the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the region into Middle and West Francia. They were vassals either of the King of France or of the Holy Roman Emperor.

The Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern United Provinces and the Southern Netherlands. Southern Netherlands were ruled by the Spanish and the Austrian Habsburgs. This made up most of modern Belgium.

After the campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars, the Low Countries were added into the French First Republic. This ended Austrian rule in the area. Adding back the Low Countries formed the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. This happened at the end of the First French Empire in 1815.

The Belgian Revolution was in 1830. Leopold became king on 1831. This is now celebrated as Belgium's National Day.

thumb|left|Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution of 1830 (1834), by Egide Charles Gustave Wappers, Museum of Ancient Art, Brussels]]
The Berlin Conference of 1885 gave control of the Congo Free State to King Leopold&nbsp;II. Millions of Congolese people were hurt or killed, mostly to make rubber, and Leopold became very wealthy. In 1908 the Belgian state took control of the colony after a scandal about the deaths.

Germany invaded Belgium in 1914. This was part of World War I. The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium. During the war Belgium took over Ruanda-Urundi (modern-day Rwanda and Burundi). After the War, the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy were added into Belgium in 1925. The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940 and under German control until 1944. After World War II, the people made king Leopold III leave his throne in 1951. This is because they thought he helped the Germans. Belgium joined NATO as a founding member.

In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule. Two years later Ruanda-Urundi also became free.

Geography

Belgium is next to France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Its total area is 34,143&nbsp;square kilometers (including sea area).

Politics
thumb|230x230px|[[Philippe of Belgium, current King]]
Since 1993, Belgium is a federal state, divided into three regions and three communities.

Regions:
 Brussels-Capital Region
 Flemish Region (or Flanders)
 Walloon Region (or Wallonia)

Communities:
 Flemish Community
 French Community of Belgium
 German-speaking Community of Belgium

It has a system of government known as a constitutional monarchy, meaning that it has a monarch, but that the monarch does not rule the country, and that a government is elected democratically.

Belgium has had its own monarchy since 1831. King Albert II left the throne on July 21, 2013 and the current king is Philippe.

In Belgium, the government is elected. Between mid-2010 and late 2011, after no clear result in the election, Belgium had no official government, until Elio Di Rupo became Prime Minister. Flanders and Wallonia both also have their own regional governments, and there is a notable independence movement in Flanders. Alexander De Croo is currently the Prime Minister.

Military
The Belgian Armed Forces have about 46,000 active troops. In 2009 the yearly defence budget was $6 billion. There are four parts: Belgian Land Component, or the Army; Belgian Air Component, or the Air Force; Belgian Naval Component, or the Navy; Belgian Medical Component.

Science and technology
thumb|upright|[[Gerardus Mercator]]

Adding to science and technology has happened throughout the country's history. cartographer Gerardus Mercator, anatomist Andreas Vesalius, herbalist Rembert Dodoens and mathematician Simon Stevin are among the most influential scientists.

Chemist Ernest Solvay and engineer Zenobe Gramme gave their names to the Solvay process and the Gramme dynamo in the 1860s. Bakelite was formed in 1907–1909 by Leo Baekeland. A major addition to science was also due to a Belgian, Georges Lemaître. He is the one who made the Big Bang theory of the start of the universe in 1927.

Three Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine were awarded to Belgians: Jules Bordet in 1919, Corneille Heymans in 1938 and Albert Claude together with Christian De Duve in 1974. Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977. Two Belgian mathematicians have been awarded the Fields Medal: Pierre Deligne in 1978 and Jean Bourgain in 1994.

In February 2014, Belgium became the first country in the world to legalize euthanasia without any age limits.

There have been many additions to painting and architecture. Several examples of major architectural places in Belgium belong to UNESCO's World Heritage List. In the 15th century the religious paintings of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden were important. The 16th century had more styles such as Peter Breughel's landscape paintings and Lambert Lombard's showing of the antique. The style of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck was strong in the early 17th century in the Southern Netherlands.

During the 19th and 20th centuries many original romantic, expressionist and surrealist Belgian painters started. These include James Ensor and other artists in the Les XX group, Constant Permeke, Paul Delvaux and René Magritte. The sculptor Panamarenko is still a remarkable figure in contemporary art. The artist Jan Fabre and the painter Luc Tuymans are other internationally known figures in contemporary art.

Belgian contributions to architecture were also in the 19th and 20th centuries. Victor Horta and Henry van de Velde were major starters of the Art Nouveau style.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were major violinists, such as Henri Vieuxtemps, Eugène Ysaÿe and Arthur Grumiaux. Adolphe Sax invented the saxophone in 1846. The composer César Franck was born in Liège in 1822. Newer music in Belgium is also famous. Jazz musician Toots Thielemans and singer Jacques Brel have made global fame. In rock/pop music, Telex, Front 242, K's Choice, Hooverphonic, Zap Mama, Soulwax and dEUS are well known. In the heavy metal scene, bands like Machiavel, Channel Zero and Enthroned have a worldwide fan-base.

Belgium has several well-known authors, including the poet Emile Verhaeren and novelists Hendrik Conscience, Georges Simenon, Suzanne Lilar and Amélie Nothomb. The poet and playwright Maurice Maeterlinck won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1911. The Adventures of Tintin by Hergé is the best known of Franco-Belgian comics. Many other major authors, including Peyo, André Franquin, Edgar P. Jacobs and Willy Vandersteen brought the Belgian cartoon strip industry a worldwide fame.

Belgian cinema has brought a number of mainly Flemish novels to life on-screen. Belgian directors include André Delvaux, Stijn Coninx, Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne. Well-known actors include Jan Decleir and Marie Gillain. Successful films include Man Bites Dog and The Alzheimer Affair.

Cuisine

Belgium is famous for beer, chocolate, waffles and french fries. French fries were first made in Belgium. The national dishes are "steak and fries with salad", and "mussels with fries".
Other local fast food dishes include a Mitraillette. Brands of Belgian chocolate and pralines, like Côte d'Or, Guylian, Neuhaus, Leonidas, Corné and Galler are famous. Belgium makes over 1100 varieties of beer. The Trappist beer of the Abbey of Westvleteren has repeatedly been rated the world's best beer. The biggest brewer in the world by volume is Anheuser-Busch InBev, based in Leuven.

Sports

Since the 1970s, sports clubs are organised separately by each language community. Association football is one of the most popular sports in both parts of Belgium, together with cycling, tennis, swimming and judo. With five victories in the Tour de France and many other cycling records, Belgian Eddy Merckx is said to be one of the greatest cyclists of all time. Jean-Marie Pfaff, a former Belgian goalkeeper, is said to be one of the greatest in the history of football (soccer). Belgium and The Netherlands hosted the UEFA European Football Championship in 2000. Belgium hosted the 1972 European Football Championships.

Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin both were Player of the Year in the Women's Tennis Association. The Spa-Francorchamps motor-racing circuit hosts the Formula One World Championship Belgian Grand Prix. The Belgian driver, Jacky Ickx, won eight Grands Prix and six 24 Hours of Le Mans. Belgium also has a strong reputation in motocross. Sporting events held each year in Belgium include the Memorial Van Damme athletics competition, the Belgian Grand Prix Formula One, and a number of classic cycle races such as the Tour of Flanders and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The 1920 Summer Olympics were held in Antwerp.

History
The first people to come to Brazil came around 9,000 B.C. That group of indigenous people is often called the South American Indians and probably came from North America. They practiced hunting, foraging, and farming. Over thousands of years, many different indigenous people were living there.
thumb|Flag of Brazil, 1500
Pedro Álvares Cabral was the first European to see Brazil. He saw it in 1500. He was from Portugal and the Portuguese kingdom claimed Brazil. Soon, Portugal colonized Brazil and created colonies all along the coastline. They began to import black slaves from Africa and force them to work. Because of the violence of the slave masters, many of these slaves would run away into the forest and create their own communities called quilombos.

In the late 1500s and early 1600s, the Dutch and the French tried to take some land in Brazil. Dutch, French, and Portuguese started moving inland further than the Treaty of Tordesillas said they could. This caused some fights with the Spaniards (people from Spain) and indigenous people in the area. Slavery was legally abolished in 1888.

In 1889, there was a military coup, and Pedro II had to leave the country. It was very anti-communist and they imprisoned, tortured, or killed many people on the left.

In the 2018 elections, the controversial conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) was elected president, winning in the second round against Fernando Haddad, of the Workers Party (PT), with the support of 55.13% of the valid votes. In the early 2020s, Brazil became one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, receiving the second-highest death toll worldwide after the United States. In May 2021, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said that he would run for a third term in the 2022 Brazilian general election against Bolsonaro. In October 2022, Lula was in first place in the first round, with 48.43% of the support from the electorate, and received 50.90% of the votes in the second round. On 8 January 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration, a mob of Bolsonaro's supporters attacked Brazil's federal government buildings in the capital, Brasília, after several weeks of unrest.

Languages
The official language of Brazil is Portuguese. Brazil is the only country in South America that speaks Portuguese but more people in South America speak Portuguese than Spanish because the population of Brazil is larger than the combined population of all the Spanish-speaking countries in South America.

Some people in Brazil speak German dialects. That came from German immigrants. 2% of Brazilians speak German as their first language. Yiddish is spoken by the elders of the Jewish community.

Other people in Brazil speak their ancestors' languages like Italian, Japanese, Polish, Ukrainian, French, Russian, Lithuanian, Chinese, Dutch and Korean. Spanish or "Portunhol", a mix of Portuguese and Castilian (Spanish) is spoken at some of the borders. Indigenous languages as Guarani and Aymará are the first languages of a small number of Brazilians.

Geography
Brazil has the world's largest rainforest, the Amazon Rainforest. It makes up 40% of the country's land area. Brazil also has other types of land, including a type of savanna, called cerrado, and a dry plant region named caatinga.

The most important cities are Brasília (the capital), Belém, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Florianópolis, Fortaleza, Goiânia, Maceió, Manaus, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, São Paulo (the biggest city) and Vitória. Other cities are at List of largest cities in Brazil.

Brazil is divided into 26 states plus the Federal District in five regions (north, south, northeast, southeast and centre-west):
 North: Acre, Amazonas, Rondônia, Roraima, Pará, Amapá, Tocantins
 Northeast: Maranhão, Pernambuco, Ceará, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia
 Centre-West: Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Distrito Federal/ Federal District
 Southeast: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais
 South: Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul

The country is the fifth-largest in the world by area. It is known for its many rainforests and jungles. It is next to every country in South America except Chile and Ecuador.
The name Brazil comes from a tree named brazilwood.

Culture
Brazil is the largest country in South America and the fifth-largest in the world. Its people are called Brazilians or Brasileiros (In Portuguese). The people include citizens of Portuguese or other European descent who mainly live in the South and Southeast, Africans, Native Americans, Arabs, Gypsies, and people of mixed ancestry. Brazil also has the largest Japanese community outside Japan. Other East Asians follow the Japanese group. The Amazon River flows through Brazil, it is the 2nd longest river in the world (after the Nile). The current President of Brazil is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Two major sporting events were held in Brazil recently: the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Sport
In 2016 Brazil became the first South America country to host the Summer Olympics.

Chemistry
thumb|200px|Chemistry is the science of [[chemical elements and compounds]]

Chemistry is the science that studies what everything is made of and how it changes. It looks at matter, which is anything that takes up space. Chemistry tries to understand how matter is built, how it behaves, and how it can change. Chemistry explores how tiny particles called atoms and molecules come together, break apart, or rearrange to form new substances. People often call chemistry the “central science” because it connects other sciences like physics (which studies energy and forces) and biology (which studies living things). Chemistry helps explain things all around us, like why iron rusts, how food gives us energy, and how soap cleans our hands.

The history of chemistry is very long. Thousands of years ago, people in places like Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China used early forms of chemistry in their daily lives. They practiced metalworking, made dyes for clothes, and learned to ferment food and drinks. These skills were based on watching and experimenting, even though people did not yet understand the science behind them. Later, a practice called alchemy became popular. Alchemists hoped to turn ordinary metals into gold and find a magic liquid that would give eternal life. Even though their ideas were not always scientific, alchemists invented tools and methods that helped future scientists. In the 1600s, chemistry began to change. Scientists like Robert Boyle said that experiments, not just ideas, should be used to understand the world. In the 1700s, Antoine Lavoisier carefully measured chemicals and discovered that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only changed. This became a key idea in modern chemistry. As time went on, scientists developed the atomic theory, created the periodic table, and learned how atoms bond together.

Chemistry is a type of physical science, which means it focuses on understanding matter and how it changes using careful measurements and natural laws. It is closely related to physics, especially in areas like heat and energy (thermodynamics), the behavior of tiny particles (quantum mechanics), and how fast reactions happen (kinetics). These help scientists understand how and why chemical reactions take place. While physics looks for broad, universal rules, chemistry often focuses on how specific molecules and materials behave. Chemists study how atoms come together to form molecules, how energy moves during reactions, and how things like temperature, pressure, and the amount of each substance can affect the speed of a reaction. Using tools and models, chemistry helps us explore both the tiny world of atoms and the larger world of solids, liquids, gases, and plasma. It plays a big role in helping us understand the materials that make up everything around us.

Chemistry is not a subject that stands alone. It is closely connected to many other sciences. Chemistry and physics are closely linked because the movement of atoms, energy, and tiny particles like electrons all follow the laws of physics. In biology, chemistry helps us understand how living things work. It explains how enzymes speed up reactions in the body, how DNA carries genetic information, and how cells turn food into energy. This area of science is called biochemistry. In geology, chemistry helps us learn what rocks and minerals are made of, how volcanoes work, and how elements move through Earth’s surface, oceans, and air. Chemistry is also important in environmental science, astronomy, engineering, and making new materials. Because of these connections, chemistry is one of the most important and wide-reaching sciences.

By around 5000 BCE, people began to discover a new use for fire, making metal from rocks. This early process was called smelting. It marked the beginning of metallurgy, the science of working with metals. Before this, people mostly used native metals, which are found in nature in pure form, like small lumps of gold or copper. But now, they learned how to get copper out of rocks called ores, such as malachite or azurite. To smelt copper, they had to heat the ore in a very hot fire, hot enough to melt the metal and separate it from the rock. This was not easy. It required skill in building and controlling fire. Sometimes they used tools like bellows to blow air and make the fire hotter. They also had to choose the right rocks and other materials to help the process work better. The result was soft copper, which could be shaped into tools, weapons, and jewelry.

One of the earliest examples of prehistoric chemistry was using natural pigments for cave paintings. People ground up minerals like ochre (which is made of iron oxide), charcoal (which is made of carbon), and manganese dioxide into powders. They mixed these powders with animal fat or water to make paint. People used these paints for rock art and decorating their bodies. Another important skill was tanning hides. This meant soaking animal skins in plants with tannins, like tree bark. This process made the leather last longer, stay flexible, and be useful for making clothes or tools. Fermentation also started during this time. At first, it probably happened by accident when fruit or grains went sour. As early as 7000 BCE, people in China were mixing rice, honey, and fruit to make a kind of early alcoholic drink. At the same time, people in Mesopotamia and Egypt were learning how to brew beer and make bread rise by fermenting dough. These processes used wild yeasts and bacteria to turn sugars into alcohol or carbon dioxide, which changed the taste and texture of the food. Even though they did not know about microorganisms, early humans figured out how to make fermentation work.

Metals like gold, silver, and copper became very special. Gold was rare, shiny and beautiful, and also did not get dull or rust, so it was used for ceremonies and to show status. Silver was shiny and easy to shape, so it was used for jewelry and everyday items. Copper was valuable because it could be made into tools and weapons. People started mining these metals on purpose and trading them. One of the biggest discoveries was mixing copper with tin to make bronze. Bronze was first made about 3300 BCE, during the time between the late Stone Age and the early Bronze Age. The oldest proof of making bronze comes from Mesopotamia, an area that is now Iraq and parts of Syria and Turkey. People there started mixing copper with tin to make a metal that was stronger and lasted longer. This new way of making metal eventually spread to other places like the ancient Near East, Europe, and the Indus Valley. Bronze was stronger and harder than tin or copper alone. This was one of the first times people made a new material on purpose by combining substances. Bronze tools and weapons helped societies grow, build cities, and create professional armies.

Ancient Chemistry
thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek glass amphora from the Hellenistic period.]]
In ancient civilizations, chemistry started to become more organized and intentional. Unlike the earlier times when people learned mostly by guessing and trying things out, ancient cultures began to keep records and follow steps more carefully. Even though they did not know about atoms or molecules, they still learned how to change and use natural materials in useful ways. Civilizations like ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, China, and Greece all made important contributions. They used chemistry for everyday needs like making metal tools, preserving food, and creating medicines. They also used it for spiritual or religious reasons, such as preparing bodies for burial (embalming), making perfumes, or using special materials in ceremonies. These cultures wrote down their ideas and methods on things like clay tablets and scrolls. This helped them improve their techniques and pass knowledge down to future generations.

In ancient Egypt, chemistry was closely connected to religion, medicine, and daily life. The Egyptians were skilled at using natural materials like minerals, dyes, and plant resins, especially when it came to preserving bodies for the afterlife. They used a special salt mixture called natron, made of natural chemicals like baking soda and salt, to dry out dead bodies and prevent decay. They also added oils, herbs, and resins to stop bad smells and protect the body. Egyptians were also talented metalworkers. They knew how to melt down copper ores like malachite in hot furnaces using charcoal to get pure metal. They used metals like gold, copper, and lead to make tools, jewelry, and statues. They also made green eye paint from malachite and black eyeliner (kohl) from a mineral called galena (lead sulfide). These were not just for beauty. They were believed to help protect their eyes from infections and bright sunlight. Egyptians also made perfumes and scented oils by mixing plant parts, resins, and fats. They used early versions of extraction methods, like soaking flowers in oils or using heat. Some even think they may have used very simple distillation to collect scents. One of their greatest chemical achievements was glass-making. As early as 1500 BCE, they were making colorful glass beads and jars using a mix of sand (silica), soda (a type of salt), and lime, all melted together in hot ovens. By adding different metals, they could change the color. Copper made blue, iron made green, and manganese made purple. Chemistry also played a role in Egyptian medicine. Ancient texts like the Ebers Papyrus included hundreds of recipes for medicines made from minerals, herbs, and animal parts. Some treatments were based on beliefs and rituals, but many were surprisingly accurate and showed real knowledge of how the human body reacted to certain substances.

In Mesopotamia, especially in places like Sumer and Babylon, people made important early discoveries in chemistry, mostly through practical work. They wrote down their knowledge on clay tablets using a writing system called cuneiform. These records show in detail how they used different materials. One of their biggest contributions was in metalworking. The Sumerians and Babylonians learned how to get metals like copper, tin, lead, silver, and gold from rocks called ores. They built furnaces hot enough to melt these ores. By mixing copper and tin, they created bronze, a strong metal used for making tools, weapons, and art. This marked the start of the Bronze Age. Pottery and ceramics were also important. They used kilns (hot ovens) to bake clay and to make glazes, which gave pottery shiny, colorful finishes. These glazes were made by mixing minerals and metal powders like copper or iron, which changed color when heated. Pottery was used in homes, temples, and for special objects. Mesopotamians also made progress in perfume-making. Ancient clay tablets from cities like Mari and Babylon describe how they got scents from plants, spices, and tree resins. They may have used early versions of distillation, heating ingredients and collecting the vapor to concentrate smells. These perfumes were used in religious ceremonies, for personal grooming, and sometimes in medicine. Another interesting substance they used was bitumen, a sticky, black natural material similar to modern asphalt. They used it for building, waterproofing, and even to preserve bodies like in mummification.

In ancient India, people had a deep and detailed knowledge of chemistry, especially in medicine and spiritual practices. This knowledge was recorded in early texts like the Vedas and Ayurvedic writings. One major area of chemical knowledge was Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine. Ayurvedic healers used herbs, minerals, and even animal products to make medicines that matched each person’s body type, known as a dosha. These healers used careful steps like heating, grinding, and washing to prepare them. For example, they used mercury (called rasa) in special medicines called rasaushadhis, often mixing it with sulfur. Ancient Indian alchemy, called Rasayana Shastra, also played a big role. While it had mystical goals like living longer or turning base metals into gold, it led to real scientific progress. They used early chemical techniques like calcination (marana), distillation (patan), sublimation (sublimna), and fermentation (sandhana). They built and used tools such as yantras (distillers), musha (crucibles), and retorts (curved tubes), often made from clay or metal. Metallurgy, the science of working with metals, was another area where ancient India stood out. Indian blacksmiths were some of the first to smelt iron, and by the first millennium BCE, they had invented a special kind of strong steel called Wootz steel. This steel was famous for its strength and was traded all over the world. A great example of their skill is the Iron pillar of Delhi, built around the 4th century CE, which has not rusted much even after 1,600 years. India was also among the first cultures to extract and purify zinc. They worked with metals like gold, silver, copper, and lead. In daily life, Indian chemistry showed up in dyeing, cosmetics, and perfumery. Artisans made colorful dyes from plants and minerals for clothes and art. They made perfumes and incense by collecting scented oils from flowers and herbs using early forms of distillation. These recipes and tools were written down in books like the Brihat Samhita, which explained not just what to use, but how to prepare each substance step by step.

In ancient China, chemistry was closely connected to Taoist beliefs and natural ideas, especially the concepts of yin and yang and the Five Elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ideas helped guide how people thought substances changed and interacted with each other. One of the most important parts of Chinese chemistry was alchemy, “the way of the elixir”. Alchemists tried to create special elixirs, magical mixtures that they believed could bring immortality or spiritual powers. They used materials like mercury, sulfur, arsenic, and other minerals and metals. While some of these elixirs were dangerous or poisonous, the work led to better knowledge of how different substances behaved and reacted. For example, Chinese alchemists learned how to heat cinnabar (a mercury mineral) to get liquid mercury. These experiments accidentally led to one of the greatest discoveries in chemistry: gunpowder. Around the time of the Tang Dynasty (7th–10th century CE), Taoist alchemists trying to make an elixir of life mixed sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal, and instead discovered an explosive powder, gunpowder. This changed warfare forever and eventually spread around the world. The recipe was written down in military books like the Wujing Zongyao (written in 1044 CE). Besides alchemy and gunpowder, the Chinese were also masters of metallurgy. Long before Europe, they had created blast furnaces to make cast iron. They developed strong metal mixtures like bronze (copper and tin) and even steel. These metal tools and weapons helped China grow and succeed. Ancient China also developed medicine. Books like the Shennong Bencao Jing (written around the 1st century CE) listed hundreds of plants, minerals, and animal parts used to treat illness. Medicines were made using chemical techniques like grinding, boiling, fermenting, and roasting. Doctors noticed how different amounts, preparation styles, and combinations of ingredients affected the body, even though they explained it using traditional ideas like qi (life energy) and balance between organs. Finally, ancient Chinese people were experts in ceramics, dyeing, and glass-making. The art of making porcelain used special clay (kaolinite) and very high firing temperatures in kilns. They carefully controlled the heat and mixed minerals to make beautiful glazes. Chinese artists also used metal powders to make colorful finishes, like cobalt for blue, copper for green, and iron for brown or black.

In the history of chemistry, classical theories of matter were the early ideas people had about what everything is made of and how it changes. These ideas came from ancient civilizations long before scientists understood atoms like we do today. Even though these early theories did not use experiments like modern chemistry, they helped people start thinking about the nature and structure of matter. These ideas set the stage for many important discoveries later in chemistry.

In ancient Greece, people had different ideas about what matter was made of. One early idea came from Empedocles in the 5th century BCE. He said all matter was made of four basic elements: earth, water, air, and fire. These elements could mix and change because of two forces: love (which brings things together) and strife (which pulls things apart). Later, Aristotle added a fifth element called aether, which he believed made up the sky and stars. He also linked the four elements to qualities like hot, cold, wet, and dry, which helped explain how matter could change. Another important idea came from Democritus and his teacher Leucippus. They said that everything was made of tiny, unbreakable particles called atoms. These atoms were different in shape and size, and how they combined created all the different materials around us. Even though they did not have experiments to prove it, this idea was very similar to what scientists believe today and was very different from Aristotle’s ideas.

In ancient India, there was an idea similar to atoms in a school of thought called Vaisheshika, started by a thinker named Kanada around the 2nd century BCE. They believed that everything is made of tiny, unbreakable particles called “anu” or “paramanu.” These particles combine in different ways to make all kinds of materials. They also created a way to group things based on qualities like taste, color, and how they feel. Even though their ideas were mixed with philosophy and spirituality, they were trying to explain how things change and why there are so many different materials.

Medieval Chemistry
thumb|upright=1.3|[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus|The Alchymist, in Search of the Philosopher's Stone by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1771]]
During the medieval period (about the 5th to 15th century AD), chemistry was not yet a formal science like it is today. Instead, it was mixed with hands-on crafts, spiritual beliefs, and ideas passed down from ancient times. This period was like a bridge between ancient alchemy and the modern science of chemistry that would come later. People during this time used chemical knowledge in many parts of daily life. For example, medicine used herbal mixtures, metal-based compounds, and special liquids called elixirs to treat sickness. These were made through experiments and trial-and-error methods. Metalworking, or metallurgy, was also important. Craftsmen learned how to extract metals like iron, copper, tin, and lead from ores. They used fire and special tools to melt and combine metals, which involved real chemical changes like smelting and making alloys. Other industries like glassmaking and dyeing cloth also depended on chemistry. Workers learned how heat, minerals, and plants could change color or texture. Even though they did not fully understand why it worked, they gained skills and passed them on through guilds and workshops. This time in history helped keep old knowledge alive and slowly improved it, setting the stage for the science of chemistry to grow in the future.

During the medieval period, the Islamic world became one of the most advanced places for chemical knowledge and learning. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Islamic Golden Age (from the 8th to the 14th century) saw a great effort to collect and build upon the science of earlier civilizations. Scholars in cities like Baghdad, Cairo, and Cordoba translated important books from Greek, Persian, and Indian languages into Arabic. But they did not just copy old ideas, they improved them. One famous scientist, Jabir ibn Hayyan (known in Europe as Geber), is often called the “father of Arab chemistry.” He wrote hundreds of books describing different substances and how they reacted with each other. He also created new ways to study materials using experiments. Jabir worked with processes like distillation, crystallization, and calcination. He even helped design tools like alembics and retorts, which were used in early chemistry labs. Jabir tried to understand matter by observing its properties, like how easily it burns or changes. Even though his ideas were influenced by alchemy and religious beliefs, he took important steps toward using experiments to test ideas. His work also introduced many Arabic words for chemicals and tools that later became part of European chemistry. Other Islamic scholars, like Abu Bakr al-Razi (Rhazes) and Al-Tughra'i, continued to build on Jabir’s work. Al-Razi was especially important in medicine. He made antiseptics, acids, and cures for different illnesses. He was also one of the first people to tell the difference between trying to turn metals into gold (a common alchemical goal) and doing useful science to understand how materials behave. These Islamic chemists helped create important tools and methods that were later shared with European scientists. Their books were translated into Latin in places like Sicily and Spain, allowing European scholars to learn from their experiments. This knowledge helped Europe begin its own journey toward modern chemistry.

In medieval Europe, alchemy was shaped by a mix of ancient ideas, Christian beliefs, and mystical thinking. European alchemists believed that changing metals was not just about science, it also had a spiritual meaning. For them, turning ordinary metals into gold was a symbol of purifying the soul and reaching a higher, more perfect state. One of their main goals was to create the Philosopher’s stone, a magical substance they thought could change metals into gold and even give eternal life. Even though alchemy was full of spiritual ideas, it also led to real scientific progress. Important European alchemists like Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, and Raymond Lull helped connect mystical ideas with careful observation and early experiments. Roger Bacon, a monk, believed that learning through experiments was important and studied things like light and materials. Albertus Magnus wrote a lot about minerals and metals and helped organize what people knew about them. Raymond Lull used symbols to explain complex ideas, and some of his systems were later used to describe chemical reactions.

During the Middle Ages, the translation of books played a big role in helping chemistry grow in Europe. As Europeans came into more contact with the Islamic world, through trade, the Crusades, and the reconquest of Spain, they discovered many scientific texts written in Arabic. These included both translations of ancient Greek writings and original works by Muslim scientists. Cities like Toledo in Spain and Palermo in Italy became important places where scholars translated Arabic texts into Latin. Thanks to this, the ideas of famous Islamic chemists like Jabir ibn Hayyan and Abu Bakr al-Razi became known across Europe. Their work helped inspire European scientists and planted the seeds for future experiments. At the same time, monasteries in Europe were important for keeping and sharing knowledge. Even though monks mainly focused on religion, they also worked on tasks that used chemical skills. For example, making fancy books called illuminated manuscripts required knowledge about how to make colorful inks from minerals and plants. Monks also brewed beer, made wine, preserved food, and prepared herbal medicines. These activities were based on chemical knowledge, even if the monks did not call it “chemistry.” Craft workers in cities also helped chemistry grow through hands-on work. People like blacksmiths, potters, glassmakers, tanners, dyers, and brewers learned how to change raw materials into useful things. They melted metals, made shiny glazes for pottery, created dyes from plants and bugs, and controlled how things fermented. These workers learned by doing, often as apprentices in guilds. Even though they were not scientists, they used chemistry in their everyday jobs and passed their knowledge down through generations.

By the late Middle Ages, as Europe moved into the early modern period, alchemy started to change. People were becoming less interested in trying to make gold or find ways to live forever, because those goals rarely worked. Instead, more people began to focus on real results. Things they could see, test, and use in everyday life. One important thinker during this time was Paracelsus, a doctor in the 1500s. He believed that alchemy should be used to help people, especially in medicine. He used minerals like mercury, arsenic, and antimony in treatments, substances that were usually feared. Paracelsus is famous for saying, "The dose makes the poison," which means that even dangerous substances can be helpful if used in the right amount. This idea became an important rule in medicine and toxicology. Paracelsus also believed that people should learn about nature by observing and experimenting, not just by reading old books. He studied how chemicals reacted and how they affected the human body. This helped move chemistry away from mystical ideas and closer to real science. Another key figure was Andreas Libavius, a German doctor and chemist. He believed that knowledge should be shared clearly and openly. In 1597, he wrote Alchemia, one of the first chemistry textbooks. In it, he explained tools, techniques, and substances in a simple and organized way. This was very different from the secret codes and symbols used by older alchemists.

The Birth of Chemistry

The birth of classical chemistry in the 1500s and 1600s was a big turning point. During this time, chemistry began to move away from the old mystical ideas of alchemy and become a more careful, scientific way of understanding the world. This change happened during the Scientific Revolution, a time when people started to focus more on observing nature, doing experiments, and thinking for themselves instead of just trusting old books and beliefs. Classical chemistry did not appear overnight. It grew slowly as scientists developed better ways to test ideas, improved their lab tools, and began to think differently about matter and how it changes. One important change was that scientists started to question the old idea that everything was made of four or five elements, like earth, water, fire, and air. Instead, they looked more closely at how substances were made and how they reacted in real-life experiments. This new way of thinking helped turn chemistry into a true science, based on facts, testing, and clear thinking.

Robert Boyle was an important figure in the history of chemistry. His book The Sceptical Chymist, published in 1661, is often seen as the moment when chemistry started to move away from old alchemical ideas and become a true science. He challenged long-held beliefs about what matter is made of and how it changes. At the time, many people still believed in the old idea that everything was made of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Boyle disagreed. Instead, he suggested that all matter is made of tiny particles, which he called "corpuscles." These particles could combine in different ways to form all the materials in the world. This idea was an early step toward what we now call atomic theory. One of Boyle’s biggest contributions was his new definition of a chemical element. He said an element is a substance that cannot be broken down into anything simpler by chemical methods. Even though he did not know about all the elements we recognize today, his definition helped future scientists, like Antoine Lavoisier, build a better system for understanding them. Boyle was also a strong supporter of careful, repeatable experiments. He believed scientists should write down exactly what they did and what happened, so others could try the same experiments and check the results. This idea of clear, honest reporting is a key part of how science works today. Unlike many alchemists who kept their findings secret, Boyle wanted to share knowledge. He helped start the Royal Society of London, a group that encouraged scientists to share ideas and discoveries openly.

During the 1500s and 1600s, as chemistry was changing, the tools and techniques used in the laboratory improved a lot. Old alchemical tools like retorts, alembics, crucibles, and furnaces were still used, but they were made better. A retort was often made of glass and metal. It was used to heat liquids and collect their vapors, and helped scientists separate parts of a mixture by heating it. An alembic was another tool that helped separate and cool down gases, turning them back into liquids. Over time, alembics were made with better seals and more consistent shapes so they worked better and gave more reliable results. Crucibles were small containers used to heat materials to very high temperatures. They were often made from strong ceramics that could handle the heat and be used many times, which was especially important when working with metals and minerals. Many chemical processes were also becoming clearer and more organized. For example, distillation was used to purify substances like alcohol or perfumes. Filtration was used to separate solid bits from liquids using cloth, paper, or fine mesh. Precipitation meant making a solid appear out of a liquid by mixing certain chemicals, useful for finding out how different substances react. Crystallization helped scientists purify salts and study the shapes of crystals. Glassmaking became very important too. In places like Venice and other parts of Europe, people learned to make clear, heat-resistant glass. This allowed scientists to see what was happening inside their experiments. Tools like flasks, beakers, funnels, test tubes, and condensers became more uniform, meaning they looked and worked the same in different labs. This made it easier for scientists to copy each other’s work and learn together. New measuring tools also made a big difference. Scientists started using balances (scales) that were more sensitive, which helped them measure materials more accurately. This led to the early idea that the total amount of matter stays the same during a reaction, a key idea in modern chemistry. Thermometers, improved by people like Galileo, let scientists track temperature changes during experiments. With better tools and more exact methods, chemistry became less about guessing and more about testing, recording, and sharing results.

In the world of medicine, a new idea called iatrochemistry began to change how people thought about health and healing. Iatrochemistry combined chemistry with medicine and was based on the bold ideas of a scientist named Paracelsus. At the time, most doctors believed in humoral theory, which said sickness came from imbalances in body fluids. But Paracelsus disagreed. He believed that diseases came from outside the body or from chemical problems inside it, and that they should be treated with chemical medicines, not just herbs or bloodletting. Paracelsus introduced the idea of using minerals and man-made substances to treat illnesses. This opened the door to pharmacology, the science of making and testing medicines. By the 1600s, doctors and chemists started working together more closely. They tested materials like antimony, mercury, arsenic, and different salts and tinctures to see if they could cure diseases. Some of these early treatments were harmful or did not work well, but the process of testing, observing, and improving them helped medicine become more scientific. Apothecaries and early pharmacy labs became important places where these treatments were studied and made. At the same time, growing industries in Europe helped chemistry move forward in other ways. As people needed more metals, dyes, ceramics, textiles, and glass, workers had to learn more about how materials changed and reacted. For example, mining and metalwork required people to understand how to find and melt metal ores, how to mix metals into alloys, and how to deal with waste. These jobs needed a good understanding of heat and chemical reactions, so chemists began studying materials more carefully. In the textile and dye industries, creating bright, long-lasting colors for fabrics took a lot of experimenting. Workers used substances like alum, indigo, madder, and cochineal (a red dye made from insects) and had to figure out how to make the colors stick to the cloth. Glassmakers and potters also used chemistry to improve their crafts. They learned to mix silica, soda, and lime in just the right amounts to make clear or colorful glass. By adding small amounts of metals like cobalt for blue, copper for green, or gold for red, they could make beautiful glassware. In trying to copy Chinese porcelain, European makers studied how clays and glazes behaved when heated in kilns, leading to more discoveries in chemistry.

One of the most important changes in science during the 1600s was the creation of scientific societies. These were groups where scientists could meet, share their work, and learn from each other. One of the first and most famous of these groups was the Royal Society of London, founded in 1660. It brought together people like doctors, inventors, and scientists who were all interested in studying nature in a careful, organized way. The Royal Society had a special motto: "Nullius in verba," which means "take nobody’s word for it." This meant they believed in evidence and experiments, not just trusting old books or famous people. Scientists had to prove their ideas through testing and clear results. This approach was a big step forward in turning chemistry into a serious science. Similar groups started in other countries too. In France, the Académie des Sciences was created in 1666. These societies gave chemistry a new home in public places where experiments could be watched, repeated, and discussed by others. Scientists now had places to show their work, get feedback, and improve their ideas based on what others had done. Another big change was the rise of scientific journals. These were like magazines for scientists to publish their discoveries. The Royal Society started one of the first, called Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, in 1665. It helped chemists share their methods, tools, and results with other scientists across Europe. This helped science move faster because others could repeat experiments, test new ideas, or improve old ones. Books like Physica Subterranea by Johann Joachim Becher and writings by Georg Ernst Stahl (who supported the phlogiston theory) showed how print helped scientists share and debate their ideas, even when they did not agree. In addition to books and journals, letters were very important. Scientists like Robert Boyle, Antoine Lavoisier, Isaac Newton, and Robert Hooke often wrote to each other, sharing drawings, experiments, and new ideas. These letters helped build an international community of scientists, even before the internet or telephones existed. At first, chemistry was not seen as important as math or physics. Some people thought it was too close to the strange ideas of alchemy. But chemistry began to earn respect because it was useful and connected to the Age of Enlightenment, a time when people believed in reason, progress, and discovery. Slowly, universities began teaching chemistry, and students got to learn in real labs, not just from books. This helped turn chemistry into a respected professional science, just like it is today.

The Chemical Revolution

At the start of the 18th century, chemistry still relied on old ideas from alchemy and natural philosophy. One of the most famous ideas was the phlogiston theory, first created by Johann Joachim Becher and later improved by Georg Ernst Stahl. This theory said that all things that could burn had a special substance called phlogiston inside them. Phlogiston was thought to be invisible and weightless, and was released when something burned. According to the phlogiston theory, when a material burned or when metal rusted, it was losing phlogiston into the air. For example, when wood turned into ash or iron became rust, people believed the phlogiston left the material, and what was left behind was called “dephlogisticated.” This idea also tried to explain other things, like how animals breathe, thinking that breathing was the slow release of phlogiston from the body. The phlogiston theory seemed to explain many observations about fire and burning, so it became very popular in European chemistry for many years. However, no one could ever find or measure phlogiston directly. Scientists could not isolate it or prove it was real. Sometimes they had to change the idea to fit what they saw. For example, when metals actually gained weight after burning, they said phlogiston had "negative weight," which did not make sense.

One of the biggest changes in 18th-century chemistry was the rise of pneumatic chemistry, which is the study of gases and their properties. Chemists like Stephen Hales helped start pneumatic chemistry by inventing special tools to catch and measure gases. He used a method to collect gases over water, which let scientists isolate different kinds of “airs” (what people called gases back then). This was a big deal because it gave chemists a way to study gases carefully and learn how they acted. Building on this work, Joseph Black made an important discovery with a gas called carbon dioxide, which he called “fixed air.” Black showed that fixed air was different from normal air. He found that this gas could put out flames and that it reacted with limewater to make a solid. These tests proved that fixed air had its own special chemical properties. Black’s discovery showed that air was not just one thing but a mix of different gases.

The study of gases led to many important discoveries. Henry Cavendish found hydrogen, which he called “inflammable air” because it burned easily with a pale blue flame. Cavendish also showed that when hydrogen burns, it combines with oxygen to make water. This was a big surprise because people used to think water was a basic element. Cavendish proved that water is actually made of two gases, which changed how scientists understood chemistry. At the same time, two chemists, Joseph Priestley and Carl Wilhelm Scheele, both discovered oxygen. They found this gas independently, but Priestley was the first to publish his results. He called it “dephlogisticated air” because he believed in the phlogiston theory, thinking oxygen was air that had lost something called phlogiston. Scheele probably found oxygen first but published later. He described oxygen’s strong ability to help things burn and support breathing, though he also still believed in the old phlogiston ideas. Even though their ideas about phlogiston were wrong, these discoveries of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide changed chemistry forever. These findings helped lead to the end of the phlogiston theory and the start of modern chemistry.

Even though scientists had made big discoveries about gases and started to question the phlogiston theory, it was a French chemist named Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier who finally proved the theory wrong and helped create modern chemistry. Lavoisier showed that burning and breathing were not about releasing an invisible substance called phlogiston. Instead, these were chemical reactions where things combined with oxygen, which is a part of air. Lavoisier did careful experiments where he weighed things before and after chemical reactions. He found out that the total weight stayed the same, even though the substances changed. This idea is called the conservation of mass, meaning matter cannot be made or destroyed, only changed into something new. This was a brand-new way of thinking that went against the old phlogiston ideas.

Besides his important experiments, Lavoisier knew it was necessary to have a clear and simple way to name chemicals. Before his work, chemical names were confusing because the same substance could have different names in different places. In 1787, Lavoisier and his helpers, like Berthollet and Guyton de Morveau, created a system to name chemicals based on what they were made of and their properties. This made it easier for scientists to talk and work together. In 1789, Lavoisier published a famous book called Traité Élémentaire de Chimie. This book is considered the first modern chemistry textbook. In it, he clearly explained what chemical elements are, substances that cannot be broken down into simpler parts by chemical means. He also listed many elements known at the time, such as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and some metals. This helped create the idea of elements that chemists still use today. Lavoisier’s work also led to a new way of studying chemistry called stoichiometry. This means understanding the exact amounts of substances used and produced in chemical reactions. He introduced balanced chemical equations that showed these reactions in symbols and numbers. Because of this, chemistry became a science based on measurements and math, making it easier to predict and repeat experiments.

The Rise of Modern Chemistry
right|thumb|Various atoms and [[molecules as depicted in John Dalton's A New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808)]]
In the 19th century, a big change in chemistry was the development of atomic theory by John Dalton, an English teacher and chemist. In 1803, Dalton said that everything is made of tiny, invisible particles called atoms. Each element is made of its own kind of atom, and each kind has a specific weight. Dalton’s idea was based on careful observations and experiments. He also explained that atoms combine in simple, whole-number amounts to form compounds. This helped explain why compounds always have the same kinds of atoms in the same amounts. For example, carbon and oxygen make two different compounds: carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂). In these compounds, the amount of oxygen compared to carbon is always in simple ratios like 1 to 2. Dalton’s work supported the idea that matter is made of small, separate particles. He even made one of the first lists of atomic weights, comparing everything to the weight of hydrogen atoms. Dalton also used special symbols to stand for atoms and molecules, which later became the chemical symbols we use today.

In the 19th century, there was a big change in how scientists understood organic chemistry. For a long time, people believed in something called vitalism. This was the idea that organic compounds, chemicals found in living things, could only be made by living organisms because of a special "vital force." They thought these compounds could not be made in a lab. But in 1828, a German chemist named Friedrich Wöhler did an important experiment that changed everything. He heated a simple chemical called ammonium cyanate, which is inorganic (not made by living things), and it turned into urea, a compound found in the urine of living organisms. This showed that organic compounds could be made in the lab without any living organism involved. Wöhler’s discovery opened the door for scientists to study and create many more organic compounds. Chemists started working with a wide range of carbon-based substances like alcohols, acids, dyes, and medicines. One important result of Wöhler’s work was a new focus on chemical structure. Scientists discovered that certain groups of atoms, called functional groups, determine how molecules behave. Chemists like Justus von Liebig and August Kekulé helped develop ideas about how atoms bond together in molecules. Kekulé, for example, suggested the famous ring shape of the benzene molecule in 1865.

In the 1800s, one of the biggest breakthroughs in chemistry came from a Russian scientist named Dmitri Mendeleev. In 1869, Mendeleev created the periodic table which completely changed how scientists understood the building blocks of matter. At that time, about 63 elements were known, but they seemed like a random list with no clear pattern. Mendeleev had a smart idea. He arranged the elements in rows and columns based on their atomic weights and how they reacted chemically. When he did this, he noticed a repeating pattern in their properties. He called this the “periodic law”. What made his table special was that he left blank spaces where he thought unknown elements would one day fit. He even predicted what these missing elements would be like, what their atomic weights would be and how they would behave. Later, scientists discovered elements like germanium, scandium, and gallium, and they turned out to be almost exactly as Mendeleev had predicted.

In the 1800s, chemistry made big leaps forward, especially in the areas of analysis and energy. One of the most exciting new tools was spectroscopy, which was developed in the 1850s by two scientists named Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. They discovered that when elements are heated or excited, they give off light in unique patterns, like fingerprints. These patterns, called spectral lines, helped scientists identify which elements were present in a substance just by looking at the light it gave off. Using this new technique, Bunsen and Kirchhoff found two new elements, cesium in 1860 and rubidium in 1861, by their special spectral lines. Spectroscopy did not just help on Earth; it also helped scientists study stars. By looking at the light from stars, they could figure out what elements the stars were made of, even from millions of miles away. Spectroscopy started helping astronomers in the early 1800s. Scientists noticed that when sunlight passed through a special glass called a prism, it created a rainbow of colors, but with some dark lines missing. In 1802, W. H. Wollaston saw these dark lines, and in 1815, Joseph von Fraunhofer studied them more closely. These dark lines were called absorption lines, and they were very important. They showed that certain colors of light were being absorbed by gases in the Sun’s outer layers. This gave scientists their first clues about what the Sun was made of. Later, the same method helped astronomers figure out the chemical makeup of other stars, too. At the same time, chemists were also learning more about how energy works in chemical reactions. A scientist named Germain Hess came up with Hess’s Law, which says that the total energy change in a chemical reaction is the same, no matter how many steps it takes. Later, James Prescott Joule made another big discovery. He showed that heat and mechanical energy (like moving parts) are really just different forms of the same thing. His famous experiment with a paddle wheel helped prove this. These ideas became part of the first law of thermodynamics, which says that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only change form.

The Industrial Revolution in the 1800s brought big changes to the world, and chemistry played a major role in making that happen. One of the biggest breakthroughs was in steelmaking. In the 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a process to turn melted iron into strong steel by blowing air through it to remove unwanted materials. This Bessemer process made steel much cheaper and easier to produce. As a result, steel was used to build railroads, ships, bridges, and buildings all over the world. At the same time, chemistry helped create synthetic dyes. In 1856, a young chemist named William Henry Perkin was trying to make medicine but accidentally created a bright purple dye called mauveine. This dye was the first of its kind and made colorful clothing affordable for many people. Perkin’s discovery started a new industry, and soon many companies were making different kinds of synthetic dyes for clothes and fabrics. Explosives were another area where chemistry made a big impact. Chemists like Ascanio Sobrero and Alfred Nobel developed powerful materials such as nitroglycerin and dynamite. These explosives were used in mining, building tunnels, and even in war. Nobel’s inventions made blasting safer and more effective. He later created the Nobel Prizes to honor great achievements in science and other fields. Chemistry also helped farmers by improving fertilizers. Scientists like Justus von Liebig discovered that plants need certain minerals to grow well. This led to the creation of artificial fertilizers like superphosphates and ammonium salts, which helped crops grow faster and better. These fertilizers supported a growing population and helped feed more people. Finally, chemistry changed medicine. Scientists learned how to take useful chemicals from plants and make them in labs. Important medicines like aspirin, morphine, and quinine were produced in large amounts, making them more available to people around the world. This helped save lives and treat diseases more effectively.

During the 1800s, chemistry became a more organized and respected science. One of the biggest changes was that chemistry started to be taught seriously at universities. Before this time, most science was done by individuals working on their own. But now, schools in Europe and North America began to understand that experimental science, like chemistry, could help improve society and make countries stronger. Chemistry got its own professors (called university chairs) and special laboratories where students could learn both ideas and hands-on experiments. One of the most famous schools for this was the University of Giessen in Germany, where Justus von Liebig started a chemistry lab in the 1820s. His lab became a model for others around the world. Liebig believed students should learn by doing research and experiments, not just by listening to lectures. Many important chemists were trained there, and the idea of the "chemical laboratory" became common in schools. Outside of schools, scientific societies also helped chemistry grow. In 1841, the Chemical Society of London was founded. It gave chemists a place to share their work, honor great discoveries, and influence government decisions. Similar groups formed in other countries, like the Deutsche Chemische Gesellschaft in Germany. These groups helped chemists stay connected and work together. Another important part of this time was the rise of science journals. Chemists needed a way to share their discoveries with others. In 1832, Liebig started a journal called Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, where chemists could publish their findings. It was carefully reviewed by other scientists, which helped make the information trustworthy. As more journals were created, new discoveries spread faster and helped science move forward. As chemistry became more organized, it also became more of a professional career. Chemists were no longer just curious hobbyists or workers in factories, they were seen as trained professionals with special skills. Companies started building their own industrial labs and hiring chemists to help make products like medicine, fabric dyes, and metals. This helped turn chemistry into an important part of both science and industry.

20th Century Chemistry
In the 20th century, chemistry changed a lot because scientists made important discoveries about atoms and even smaller parts inside them. Before, people thought atoms were the smallest pieces of matter and could not be broken down. But in 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the electron, a tiny negatively charged particle inside the atom. This showed that atoms were made of smaller parts. Thomson created the “plum pudding” model, imagining electrons like little raisins stuck inside a positively charged pudding. Not long after, in 1911, Ernest Rutherford did the famous gold foil experiment. He found out that the atom is not like a pudding but has a tiny, dense, positively charged center called the nucleus, with electrons moving around it mostly through empty space. In 1913, Niels Bohr improved this idea. He said electrons move in specific paths or shells around the nucleus. They can jump between these shells by gaining or losing energy. This idea helped explain why atoms give off certain colors of light, called spectral lines. However, Bohr’s model did not work well for bigger atoms, so scientists kept exploring. In the 1920s and 1930s, a new field called quantum mechanics was created. Erwin Schrödinger suggested that electrons behave like waves, and their positions can only be described by probabilities, not exact locations. Werner Heisenberg added that we cannot know both an electron’s exact position and speed at the same time. This is called the Uncertainty Principle. These ideas came together into the modern quantum mechanical model of the atom, which is the foundation of chemistry today. It helps explain not only how atoms look and behave but also why elements are arranged in the periodic table, how atoms stick together in chemical bonds, and the shapes of molecules.

In 1913, Henry Moseley used X-rays to study atoms and discovered that an element’s place in the periodic table should be based on its atomic number (the number of protons in its nucleus), not its atomic weight. This helped fix problems in the old version of the table and made it more accurate. Moseley’s work also helped scientists find missing elements by spotting gaps in the sequence of atomic numbers. At the same time, scientists were learning about radioactivity. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium could give off invisible rays without any outside energy. Later, Marie and Pierre Curie studied this further and discovered new radioactive elements like polonium and radium. These elements gave off energy because their atoms were unstable and could break down on their own. This showed that atoms were not unchangeable after all. These discoveries led to a new field called nuclear chemistry, which focuses on the reactions that happen in an atom’s nucleus. In the 1930s, scientists like Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, Lise Meitner, and Otto Frisch discovered nuclear fission, a process where atoms like uranium split into smaller parts and release a huge amount of energy. This discovery had a huge impact. During World War II, the U.S. used nuclear fission to build the atomic bomb in a secret project called the Manhattan Project. These bombs caused massive destruction and changed the world forever. After the war, people also began using nuclear fission to make electricity in nuclear power plants. Later, scientists studied nuclear fusion, the reaction that powers the sun. Fusion could give us cleaner and safer energy, but we are still working on how to control it on Earth.

Another important breakthrough in 20th-century chemistry was the rise of physical chemistry. Physical chemistry used the principles of physics to understand matter. In the United States, an early supporter of this field was Ira Remsen, who helped improve science education by promoting hands-on experiments in chemistry classes. This helped train a new generation of scientists who were both skilled and curious. One of the most important figures in physical chemistry was Gilbert N. Lewis. He came up with the idea that atoms bond by sharing pairs of electrons. He also created the Lewis dot structure, a simple way to show how atoms are connected. His work helped people understand things like covalent bonds (where atoms share electrons), acids and bases, and chemical energy. Later, in the 1930s, Linus Pauling took these ideas even further by using quantum mechanics to explain chemical bonds. He introduced the concept of hybridization, which helped explain the shapes of molecules, like the four-cornered tetrahedral shape of methane. Pauling also created the electronegativity scale, which shows how strongly atoms attract electrons when they bond. Pauling’s impact went beyond theory. He was also a leader in using tools like X-ray crystallography and spectroscopy to figure out the exact 3D shapes of molecules. These tools became especially important in biochemistry. Pauling used them to study proteins and discovered their basic structures, such as the alpha helix and beta sheet. His work helped start the field of structural biology, which looks at how the shape of a molecule affects what it does in the body.

In the 20th century, organic chemistry, grew very quickly and made a huge impact on the world. One of the biggest changes was that chemists invented new ways to build complicated molecules with great care and precision. These new methods, like the Grignard reaction or Wittig reaction, gave scientists powerful tools to create all kinds of useful chemicals, including medicines and materials. One important part of this progress was the rise of polymer chemistry, which led to the invention of new materials called plastics. In 1935, a chemist named Wallace Carothers at DuPont created nylon, the first completely man-made fiber. This showed that large, chain-like molecules (called polymers) could be designed to have special properties, like strength or flexibility. After nylon, scientists quickly made other important materials, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), Teflon, and polyester. These plastics changed everyday life. They were used in packaging, clothing, cars, buildings, and much more. At the same time, pharmaceutical chemistry, the science of making medicines, grew rapidly. In the early 1900s, chemists had already made useful drugs like aspirin and barbiturates, but the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming changed medicine forever. Penicillin could fight deadly bacterial infections, and its mass production helped save countless lives, especially during World War II. After that came sulfa drugs, the first widely used antibiotics, which helped treat many infections even before penicillin was common. Later in the century, scientists made even more important medicines, including antiviral drugs for diseases like HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer, and medications for mental health and brain disorders. New advancements in stereochemistry and chiral synthesis made medicines safer and more effective. In the final decades of the century, techniques like combinatorial chemistry, high-speed drug testing, and computer-aided drug design helped scientists discover new medicines much faster.

In the middle of the 20th century, chemistry began to focus more on understanding the molecules that make up living things. One of the most important discoveries during this time was the structure of DNA, made by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. They used X-ray images taken by Rosalind Franklin and base-pairing rules discovered by Erwin Chargaff to figure out that DNA is shaped like a double helix, two strands twisted around each other. These strands are held together by base pairs. Adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. This discovery helped connect chemistry with biology and gave rise to a new field called biochemistry, which studies how chemicals work inside living things. Scientists began to study important molecules like proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids in more detail. They used special tools like X-ray crystallography, NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), and mass spectrometry to see the shapes and structures of these molecules. Researchers also started to understand how enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body, how cells communicate, and how metabolism works to give us energy. This new knowledge helped create another field called molecular biology, which focuses on how genes work and how cells use DNA to make proteins. In the 1970s, scientists developed ways to cut and paste DNA, creating a powerful technique called recombinant DNA technology. This let them move genes from one organism to another, helping launch the field of genetic engineering. Later, in the 21st century, scientists created an even more precise gene-editing tool called CRISPR-Cas9, which allows for direct changes to DNA. These discoveries changed many areas of life. In medicine, they led to new drugs, gene therapies, and personalized treatments based on a person’s DNA. In farming, they helped create genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that grow better and resist pests. In science, they gave researchers powerful tools to explore how life works, including how we inherit traits and how species evolve.

In the 20th century, analytical chemistry changed a lot because of new and powerful tools that helped scientists study chemicals more carefully and accurately. Before this time, scientists mostly used older methods called "wet chemistry," which involved mixing chemicals, making them change color, or forming solids to find out what was in a sample. These methods worked okay but were not precise enough for the harder problems chemists faced in fields like organic chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. One big step forward was the invention of the mass spectrometer. This tool measures the mass and charge of tiny particles called ions. Scientists like Francis Aston and Arthur Jeffrey Dempster helped improve mass spectrometry, which became super useful for finding out the weights of molecules, discovering different forms of atoms (isotopes), and identifying unknown chemicals. Mass spectrometry is so sensitive it can detect even tiny amounts of substances, down to billionths or trillionths of a gram. Another important tool was nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, first shown in the 1940s and widely used by the 1950s and 1960s. NMR lets chemists study the magnetic properties of atoms like hydrogen and carbon in molecules. This helps them understand the exact structure of molecules, how atoms bond, and how molecules move around in liquids. Later, more advanced versions of NMR allowed even deeper study of complex molecules, especially in drug research and organic chemistry. X-ray crystallography also became very important during the 20th century. This technique uses X-rays to find the three-dimensional shapes of molecules with amazing detail. At first, it was used on simple crystals, but later scientists could use it to study big molecules like vitamins, hormones, and proteins. For example, Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray images helped explain the famous double-helix structure of DNA. Over time, X-ray crystallography helped scientists learn about many complicated biological molecules, which is very important for understanding how our bodies work and for making new medicines. Other helpful tools include infrared spectroscopy, which helps identify parts of molecules by measuring vibrations, and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry, which helps chemists watch chemical reactions and study certain types of molecules. Together, these instruments made it possible for chemists to study chemicals in ways they never could before, speeding up discoveries and helping create new materials, medicines, and technologies.

By the late 20th century, the chemical industry got much bigger, including not only old areas like medicine and dyes but also new ones like petrochemicals (chemicals made from oil), agrochemicals (chemicals for farming), and advanced materials. One big change came from petrochemistry. Scientists learned how to turn crude oil into many useful chemicals. These chemicals were then used to make plastics, synthetic rubber, and solvents. These new materials changed everyday things like packaging, buildings, cars, and many other products. Another very important invention was the Haber process (also called the Haber-Bosch process). It was developed in the early 1900s by Fritz Haber and later made into a big industrial method by Carl Bosch. This process uses high pressure, high temperature, and a special iron catalyst to turn nitrogen gas from the air and hydrogen gas into ammonia (NH₃). Ammonia is a key ingredient in nitrogen fertilizers. The Haber process had a huge impact on farming. It allowed factories to make nitrogen fertilizers in large amounts, which helped farmers grow much more food. This helped feed the rapidly growing world population and played a big role in the Green Revolution, a time when farming became much more productive. Today, more than half of the people on Earth depend on food grown with fertilizers made using the Haber process. Without it, natural soil would not have enough nitrogen to grow enough food for everyone.

In the field of energy, chemists made big progress in creating new ways to produce cleaner and better power, so people would not have to rely so much on fossil fuels like oil and coal. One important invention was the fuel cell, which changes chemical energy directly into electricity using reactions between hydrogen and oxygen. Although the idea of fuel cells started way back in 1839 with Sir William Grove, it was not until the mid-1900s that fuel cells became practical. In the 1960s, companies like General Electric built hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells to power NASA’s spacecraft because they were reliable and clean. Later, in the 1990s and 2000s, fuel cells became important for clean energy cars and power stations. Chemists worked on making better catalysts, materials like platinum, that helped fuel cells work faster and last longer. At the same time, batteries got much better thanks to advances in chemistry and materials science. Early batteries, such as the lead-acid battery invented in 1859, were heavy and did not store much energy. Nickel-cadmium batteries, made in the early 1900s, could be recharged but had problems like toxicity and losing capacity over time. A big breakthrough happened in the 1980s when John B. Goodenough and his team created the lithium cobalt oxide cathode, which led to the lithium-ion battery. Sony started selling these batteries in 1991. Lithium-ion batteries are lightweight and hold a lot of energy, which changed portable devices like laptops and smartphones. They also helped make electric cars better, allowing them to travel longer distances and pushing more people toward cleaner transportation. Chemists also played a big role in solar energy by improving solar panels that turn sunlight directly into electricity. The first practical silicon solar cell was made in 1954 by Bell Labs scientists Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. This showed that solar energy could work well, although it was expensive at first. Over the years, chemists and materials scientists worked on making solar cells cheaper and more efficient by improving the materials inside them.

Beyond energy, materials science helped create many important inventions in fields like electronics, space travel, and computers. One big discovery was semiconductors, like silicon and germanium. These materials made it possible to invent the transistor in 1947 at Bell Labs by scientists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. Transistors replaced bulky vacuum tubes and made electronic devices smaller, faster, and more reliable. This invention became the building block for modern computers, phones, and other technology. In the 1980s, scientists Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller discovered high-temperature superconductors. These materials are used in powerful magnets for MRI machines and particle accelerators and could someday help build more efficient power systems. Chemists also worked on composite materials, which are made by combining two or more substances to make something stronger or better. For example, carbon fiber reinforced plastics and advanced ceramics are light but very strong and can resist heat and corrosion. These materials are used to build airplanes that use less fuel, safer and lighter cars, and even parts for rockets and spacecraft.

Even though the 20th century brought amazing discoveries in chemistry, it also caused serious problems for people and the planet. One major wake-up call came in 1962, when scientist and writer Rachel Carson published a book called Silent Spring. In it, she warned about the dangers of using pesticides like DDT without understanding the harm they could do. These chemicals were killing birds, harming wildlife, and even making people sick. Her book helped spark the environmental movement, leading to the banning of DDT in many countries and the creation of environmental protection laws and agencies. But that was not the only concern. Chemistry was also used in ways that hurt people, especially during wars. In World War I, mustard gas was used as a weapon. In the Vietnam War, chemicals like Agent Orange were sprayed to destroy forests, but they also harmed soldiers and civilians. These tragedies led to international agreements like the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993, which aimed to stop countries from using chemistry to make weapons. Factories also caused pollution by releasing toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil. This included things like heavy metals, greenhouse gases, and chlorinated hydrocarbons. Problems like acid rain, holes in the ozone layer from CFCs, and huge amounts of plastic waste showed that chemical innovation could have long-term effects on the Earth. These issues taught scientists and leaders that chemistry should be used more responsibly to protect both people and the environment.

21st Century Chemistry
Chemistry in the 21st century has continued to grow and improve in exciting ways. One of the biggest changes is the use of computers to model and predict chemical reactions. This area is called computational chemistry. It lets scientists create virtual experiments and watch how atoms and molecules behave without needing to do everything in a real lab. This saves time, money, and materials. A special method called Density Functional Theory (DFT) helps chemists understand how molecules are built, how they react, and how much energy they need. In the past, these tools could only handle small, simple molecules, but now they can work with much larger and more realistic ones. This is very useful in designing new medicines, materials, and catalysts. In 2013, three scientists, Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt, and Arieh Warshel, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in combining different types of modeling. They found a way to blend quantum mechanics with classical physics to study big, complex systems like enzymes. Another exciting development is called ultrafast laser spectroscopy. This technique uses femtosecond laser pulses (that is one quadrillionth of a second) to take snapshots of chemical reactions as they happen. It is like watching atoms and molecules moving, bonding, and changing in real time. This helps scientists better understand what is happening during reactions, including how bonds break, electrons move, and energy flows.

Scientists now use amazing tools like atomic force microscopes (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopes (STM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to look at atoms and molecules on surfaces. These tools are very important for creating things like better catalysts, tiny sensors, and nanomaterials that help clean up pollution. Scientists can also use special tools like optical tweezers to measure the forces on just one molecule at a time. Another field is nanochemistry. Chemists work with materials that are only a few nanometers wide. These materials, like quantum dots and nanoparticles, have special properties that can be used in solar panels, tiny computer chips, and targeted drug delivery that helps treat diseases more precisely. Scientists are designing better batteries, fuel cells, and machines that split water into hydrogen and oxygen, which could help us use clean energy. In biophysical chemistry, scientists combine chemistry with biology and computer science. They study how proteins fold, how enzymes work, and how cell membranes behave. Tools like cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM) and NMR machines help them see the shapes of molecules, which is very helpful in fighting diseases and creating new medicines.

In the 21st century, analytical chemistry has become much more advanced and important in many areas of science and everyday life. One big improvement has been in mass spectrometry (MS), a tool that helps scientists figure out what different chemicals are and how much of each is present. In the past, MS was mostly used for small molecules. Today, it can study large molecules, complicated mixtures, and even single cells. Modern versions, like tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and high-resolution machines such as time-of-flight (TOF) and orbitrap analyzers, are incredibly sensitive. They can detect tiny amounts of a substance, as little as one part in a trillion. These tools are used in areas like medicine, drug testing, studying proteins and cells, and checking for pollution in the environment. Another big part of analytical chemistry is chromatography, which helps separate mixtures. The most common types are gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the newer ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). UPLC, developed in the early 2000s, works faster and gives clearer results than older methods. Often, chromatography is combined with mass spectrometry to make hyphenated techniques like LC-MS/MS or GC-MS. These powerful tools can separate and identify thousands of substances in just one experiment, which is very useful in things like medical testing, making new medicines, and checking food safety. A big trend in the 21st century is making scientific tools smaller and more portable. This is called miniaturization. One exciting result of this is the creation of lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic devices. These tiny tools can do complex chemical tests on a small chip, using only tiny drops of liquid. Because they are small and easy to carry, these devices can be used outside of a regular lab, like at a patient’s bedside, in the field, or in places with few resources. They can give fast results, which is very helpful in emergencies or remote areas. These tools are used for many things, such as checking blood sugar for people with diabetes, testing for diseases, like COVID-19 or the flu, finding toxins in water or the environment, and analyzing drugs in crime investigations.

Today, analytical chemistry works closely with data science. Modern science tools create huge amounts of data, and chemists need better computer programs to help understand it all. They use things like statistics, machine learning, and pattern recognition to find useful information in the data. This helps chemists in detecting pollution in the air, water, or soil, even at tiny amounts (less than one part per billion). It also helps them find illegal drugs or chemicals in crime scenes. It also helps in tracking new pollutants like microplastics and PFAS, which used to be hard to measure. Using special tools like ICP-MS, chemists can find heavy metals (like lead or mercury) in people or the environment In medicine, analytical chemistry helps create and test new medicines. Chemists make sure drugs are pure, safe, and work the way they should. They also check that medicines stay good over time. Groups like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and EMA (European Medicines Agency) use these tests to decide if a medicine can be sold.

Biochemistry in the 21st century has grown really fast. One of the biggest achievements was the Human Genome Project, finished in 2003. Scientists were able to read the entire DNA sequence of humans for the first time. This helped researchers learn more about how genes work. How they are turned on and off, and how they make proteins. Scientists have also sequenced the DNA of many other living things, like tiny bacteria, helpful plants like Arabidopsis, and fruit flies. This helped them compare genes across species and better understand how life evolved and functions. One of the most powerful tools in today’s biochemistry is called CRISPR-Cas9. Discovered in 2012 by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna, CRISPR lets scientists edit DNA quickly and accurately. It has changed the way we do genetic engineering. With CRISPR, we could fix genetic diseases, improve crops, and study what different genes do in living things Another important area is proteomics, the study of proteins. Using mass spectrometry, scientists can now identify thousands of proteins in a sample and study how they are changed or interact with each other. This helps us understand how cells work on a very detailed level. Tools like cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM) allow scientists to actually see large molecules and protein machines in 3D, almost down to the atom. This technology was so important that it won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017.

One important area is called metabolomics, which is the study of tiny molecules (called metabolites) in cells and tissues. These molecules help us see what's really happening inside living things. Scientists now combine information from genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), and metabolomics to get a complete picture of how cells work. This big-picture approach is called systems biology. It helps scientists understand complex diseases like cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s by looking at how everything in a cell connects and works together. Biochemistry also helps in drug discovery and personalized medicine. Using computer modeling and new tools, scientists can design medicines that match a person’s specific needs. A field called pharmacogenomics studies how people’s genes affect the way they respond to medicine. This helps doctors choose the right drug and the right dose for each person. Another interesting area is synthetic biology. This is when scientists engineer living cells to do new jobs, like making biofuels, biodegradable plastics, or even new medicines. They do this by reprogramming cells with carefully chosen DNA instructions. In agriculture, biochemists are helping to create GMO (genetically modified organisms) and gene-edited crops that are healthier, more nutritious, and more resistant to pests, diseases, and climate change. By studying plant biochemistry, scientists are finding ways to help plants grow better and use water and nutrients more efficiently. Biochemistry is also key in solving global health problems. One example was the creation of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. These vaccines use molecules that tell our cells to make a harmless part of the virus, helping the immune system learn how to fight it. Scientists are now working on similar vaccines for other diseases like flu, HIV, and even cancer.

In the 21st century, chemistry has also become very important in helping us create better and cleaner ways to store and use energy. One big area of progress is rechargeable batteries. Lithium-ion batteries, which first came out in the 1990s, have gotten much better over the years. Today, they are used in many things like smartphones, laptops, and electric cars. Chemists have made these batteries safer and more powerful by creating better materials for the battery parts. Some of these materials include lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO₄) and nickel manganese cobalt (NMC). Scientists are also working on new types of batteries, like lithium-sulfur, solid-state, and sodium-ion batteries. These may be cheaper, safer, and last longer, which could help even more people use clean energy. Another exciting technology is the fuel cell. Fuel cells make electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen, and the only thing they give off is water, so they do not pollute the air. This makes them a great option for clean cars. One type, called a PEM fuel cell, is especially useful. Chemists are working on better and cheaper catalysts, which are materials that help the fuel cell work faster. One challenge with fuel cells is how to store hydrogen safely and easily. Scientists are exploring special materials, like metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and solid–state hydrides, that can hold hydrogen in a compact and safe way.

Chemists are also leading the way in improving solar energy. The most common solar panels today are made from silicon, but scientists are working on new materials that could make solar power cheaper, lighter, and more flexible. One interesting material is called a perovskite. In 2009, perovskite solar cells could only turn about 4% of sunlight into electricity. By the early 2020s, that number had jumped to over 25%. Perovskites are cheap to make and can be used on bendable surfaces, but they have some problems. They do not last very long, and they contain lead, which can be harmful. Chemists are working to fix these issues. Other types of solar panels include dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic solar cells, which can be see-through or flexible. These new types of solar cells could be used in windows or on clothing. Another interesting area is called photocatalysis. This means using sunlight to make chemical reactions happen. Scientists are developing materials like titanium dioxide mixed with tiny amounts of certain metals, that can use sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen or turn carbon dioxide into useful fuels like methanol or methane. This is similar to how plants do photosynthesis, and scientists call their version artificial photosynthesis. Chemists are also helping to make green hydrogen, a clean fuel, using a method called electrolysis. This process splits water using electricity, and it works even better when chemists add catalysts that help speed up the reaction. Chemists are also working on ways to capture carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air or from factories. They are designing new materials like amine-based liquids, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and porous carbons that can trap CO₂. Once captured, the CO₂ can be turned into fuels, plastics, or even medicines, helping to reduce pollution and fight climate change.

Chemistry is also helping to create new materials. One example is nanomaterials. These are materials made at an incredibly small scale. Chemists can now make nanoparticles, nanotubes, and nanowires with exact shapes and sizes. This has led to discoveries like carbon nanotubes and graphene, which are super strong and great at conducting electricity and heat. These materials are now being used in batteries, tiny sensors, and advanced electronics. Another new type of material are called smart materials. These materials can change when something around them changes like temperature, light, or electric signals. For example, some materials can “remember” a shape and return to it after being bent. Others can heal themselves after getting damaged. Smart materials are used in things like robotics, medical devices, and spacecraft. In medicine, special smart gels can deliver medicine exactly when and where it is needed or help new tissue grow. Polymers, which are long chains of molecules, have also improved. Chemists can now make biodegradable polymers that break down safely or design polymers for 3D printing, medicine, and even to act like proteins or DNA. Chemists can now use machine learning and computer simulations to test and find the best materials faster than ever before. Programs like the Materials Genome Initiative help scientists go from new idea to real product more quickly. Chemists are also designing electronic and photonic materials for things like flexible phone screens, glowing displays (OLEDs), and even quantum computers. Tiny particles called quantum dots are used in colorful TVs and medical imaging. And in the race to build quantum computers, special materials are helping create more stable and powerful qubits.

In the 21st century, chemistry faces many big and complicated challenges. One of the most serious is climate change. To help stop global warming, chemists are working to create cleaner energy sources. These include better solar panels, fuel cells, and batteries that do not rely on fossil fuels. But making these technologies affordable, safe, and easy to use on a large scale is still a tough problem. Another goal is to find ways to capture carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, and turn it into useful fuels or chemicals. Right now, that process uses a lot of energy and is not very efficient. Green chemistry is another important focus. Many chemical industries today use toxic substances and create a lot of waste. Chemists are now trying to design cleaner ways to make products using renewable resources, safer materials, and less energy. This shift is difficult, especially when it comes to changing how big factories operate, but it is necessary for a more sustainable future. Plastic pollution is also a major concern. Plastics are everywhere, from packaging to clothes, but they do not break down easily and often end up in oceans and soil. Chemists are working to invent biodegradable and recyclable plastics that still work well but do not harm the planet. They're also trying to find better ways to remove microplastics and other plastic waste from the environment. In the world of medicine, chemists are helping to fight antibiotic resistance and new diseases. Bacteria are becoming harder to kill. There have not been many new antibiotics in recent years. Chemists must design new drugs and ways to deliver them more effectively. There is also growing interest in personalized medicine, where treatments are made to match a person’s genes. Water shortages and polluted water are big problems in many parts of the world. Chemists are developing new ways to clean water using less energy. They are also making better sensors to detect pollutants, like pesticides and heavy metals, in the water, soil, and air. Many high-tech devices, like smartphones and electric cars, need special materials such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements. But mining these materials can harm the environment, and supplies are limited. Chemists are trying to find safer ways to extract these elements, reuse them, or even replace them with better alternatives.

Types of chemistry
There are several types of chemistry. Analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things. For example, looking at how much arsenic is in food. Organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them. For example, making acetylene. Inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them. One example is making an integrated circuit. Theoretical chemistry tries to explain chemical data with mathematics and computers.

A large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry. This looks at plastics. One example is making nylon. Because plastics are made of carbon, polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry. Another area is biochemistry. This looks at the chemistry of living things. An example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people. Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry. There are many other small branches of chemistry.

Concepts of chemistry
Matter
thumb|[[Helium is an example of matter]]
Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. This means it fills up some amount of room, even if we cannot always see it. Everything around us, from tiny grains of sand to huge planets and stars, is made of matter. Even things like air or steam, which seem invisible or light, are still matter because they are made of tiny particles that have mass and take up space. We can notice matter in many ways. Some things, like a rock or a cup of water, are easy to see and touch. Other things, like the air in a room or the gas in a balloon, are harder to notice, but they are still there. You can feel them when the wind blows or when a balloon gets bigger. Matter is really important in science, especially in chemistry and physics, because it helps us understand what everything is made of and how it behaves. All matter is made up of atoms and molecules, which are tiny building blocks.

Matter can exist in different states, or forms, depending on how its tiny particles are arranged and how much energy they have. The three most common states are solid, liquid, and gas. In a solid, the particles are packed closely together in a fixed pattern. They do not move around much, which is why solids have a definite shape and volume. For example, a rock or a pencil keeps its shape unless something forces it to change. In a liquid, the particles are still close, but they are not in a set pattern. They can slide past each other, which lets liquids flow and take the shape of their container. However, liquids still keep the same volume. A cup of water stays the same amount, whether it is in a glass or a bowl. In a gas, the particles are spread far apart and move very fast. Gases do not have a fixed shape or volume. They will spread out to fill any space they are in, like air in a balloon. Gases can also be compressed or squished into a smaller space. Besides these three, there are also other, more unusual states of matter. One is plasma, which is made of super-energized particles with electric charges. Plasma is found in things like stars and lightning. Another rare state is called a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). It happens only at very, very cold temperatures close to absolute zero. In this state, particles move so slowly they start to act like one single particle instead of many.

Matter can be grouped into two main types based on what it's made of: pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances are made of only one kind of material and have the same properties throughout. They always have the same makeup, no matter where you find them. Pure substances can be either elements or compounds. Elements are the simplest type of pure substance. They cannot be broken down into anything simpler using normal chemical methods. Each element is made of just one kind of atom. Examples include oxygen (O₂), hydrogen (H₂), and iron (Fe). There are over 100 known elements, and they are all listed in the periodic table. Compounds are also pure substances, but they are made of two or more different elements that are chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio. This means the elements combine in a specific way to form a new substance. Some examples are water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and salt (NaCl). In a compound, the elements lose their individual properties and form something completely new.

Mixtures are made when two or more substances are physically combined, not chemically joined. This means each part of the mixture keeps its own properties, and you can often separate them using simple methods like filtering, boiling, or picking them apart. Mixtures come in two main types: homogeneous and heterogeneous. A homogeneous mixture (also called a solution) looks the same all the way through. The different parts are evenly mixed, and you cannot see or easily separate them. For example, when salt dissolves in water, it becomes a solution. You cannot see the salt anymore, but it is still there. Another example is air, which is a mixture of gases. A heterogeneous mixture looks different in different parts. The substances are not evenly mixed, and you can often see and separate the different parts. Examples include a salad, sand and iron filings, or oil and water. In these mixtures, the parts stay separate and can be picked out or separated by hand or simple tools.

The properties of matter help us understand how different substances act, react, and change in various situations. These properties are usually divided into two main types: physical properties and chemical properties. Physical properties are things we can see, measure, or feel without changing what the substance is made of. These include things like color, smell, taste, melting point, boiling point, density, hardness, electrical conductivity, and solubility (how well something dissolves). For example, water boils at 100°C and freezes at 0°C. One special thing about physical properties is that they do not change the substance. You can measure them many times, and the substance stays the same. For instance, if you melt ice, it turns into liquid water, but it is still H₂O. That means it’s a physical change, not a chemical one, and it can be reversed by freezing the water again. Some physical properties depend on how much of the substance you have. These are called extensive properties, like mass and volume. Others stay the same no matter how much you have. These are called intensive properties, like density and boiling point.

Chemical properties describe how a substance can change into something completely new. Unlike physical properties, which can be seen or measured without changing the substance, chemical properties can only be observed when a chemical reaction happens. These reactions change the substance's molecular or atomic structure, meaning it becomes a different substance. Some common chemical properties include flammability (how easily something burns), reactivity with acids or bases, rusting of iron, tarnishing of silver, and the ability to decompose or oxidize. For example, when wood burns, it reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into ash, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and heat. This is a chemical change, and the fact that wood can burn is a chemical property. Another example is iron rusting. When iron is exposed to air and moisture, it reacts to form rust, which is a new substance with different properties.

Atoms
thumb|An illustration of the [[helium atom, depicting the nucleus (pink) and the electron cloud distribution (black). The black bar is one angstrom ( or ).]]
The idea of atoms goes all the way back to around 400 BCE, when ancient Greek thinkers like Democritus and Leucippus came up with the idea that all matter is made of tiny, invisible particles. They called these particles "atomos," which means "uncuttable" or "indivisible." Democritus believed that atoms had different shapes and sizes and moved through empty space, combining in different ways to make everything we see. However, this idea was just a guess. It was not based on experiments or evidence. Another famous philosopher, Aristotle, had a different idea. He believed that everything was made of just four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. Because Aristotle was very popular and influential, people accepted his ideas for almost 2,000 years, and the atom theory was mostly forgotten. That changed in the early 1800s, when an English scientist named John Dalton brought the idea of atoms back. In 1803, Dalton proposed the first modern atomic theory. He said that all matter is made of atoms, and that atoms cannot be created or destroyed. He also said that all atoms of the same element are exactly the same, and that chemical reactions happen when atoms are rearranged. Dalton’s ideas were based on experiments, especially from studying how elements combine in fixed amounts. But, Dalton thought atoms were just solid spheres like a ball with no parts inside.

As scientists built better tools and did more experiments, they began to learn much more about what was inside an atom. In 1897, a scientist named J.J. Thomson discovered the electron by using a special tube called a cathode ray tube. This showed that atoms are not solid and indivisible after all. Thomson came up with the "plum pudding model," where he imagined the atom as a ball of positive charge with negative electrons scattered inside it, like raisins in a pudding. But in 1911, Ernest Rutherford did a famous experiment with gold foil that changed this idea. He found that most of the atom is empty space, and that the positive charge is packed into a tiny, dense center called the nucleus. This led to the nuclear model of the atom, where electrons orbit around a central nucleus. However, this model still did not explain why the electrons did not just crash into the nucleus. Then in 1913, Niels Bohr improved Rutherford’s model by using ideas from quantum theory. Bohr said that electrons move in fixed energy levels or shells around the nucleus. He also said that electrons can jump from one level to another by gaining or losing energy. Bohr’s model worked well for explaining the behavior of hydrogen, the simplest atom, but it did not work as well for bigger atoms. In the 1920s, scientists created an even better model using quantum mechanics. Scientists like Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, and Max Born showed that electrons do not move in perfect orbits. Instead, they exist in areas called electron clouds or orbitals, which are regions where electrons are likely to be found. This modern model of the atom is the most accurate one we have today and helps explain how atoms behave in chemistry and physics.

An atom is the smallest unit of matter. It is the basic building block that makes up everything around us. At the center of every atom is the nucleus, a tiny, dense part that contains two types of particles: protons and neutrons. Protons have a positive charge, while neutrons have no charge, they are neutral. The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is called the atomic number, and it tells us what element the atom is. For example, all hydrogen atoms have one proton, and all oxygen atoms have eight protons. The mass number of an atom is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Because protons and neutrons are both heavy (compared to electrons), almost all of the atom’s mass is in the nucleus, even though it is very small. Outside the nucleus is where the electrons are found. Electrons are much smaller and have a negative charge. In older models, scientists thought electrons moved in set paths around the nucleus, like planets orbiting the sun. But today, we know from quantum mechanics that electrons move in regions called orbitals or electron clouds. These are areas where electrons are most likely to be found, but their exact position cannot be known for sure. Electrons are also arranged in energy levels or shells around the nucleus. Each level can hold only a certain number of electrons. Atoms are electrically neutral when they have the same number of protons and electrons. But sometimes, atoms can gain or lose electrons, which changes their overall charge. When an atom loses electrons, it becomes a positively charged ion, called a cation. When an atom gains electrons, it becomes a negatively charged ion, called an anion. Also, atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons. These are called isotopes. Even though isotopes have the same number of protons and act the same in chemical reactions, their different numbers of neutrons make them have slightly different masses. Some isotopes are stable, while others can break down over time, releasing energy.

The electron configuration of an atom is the way its electrons are arranged in different energy levels and areas around the nucleus. This arrangement is very important because it helps determine how the atom will react with other atoms and form chemical bonds. In today’s model of the atom, called the quantum mechanical model, electrons do not travel in neat circles around the nucleus like planets around the sun. Instead, they move around in areas called orbitals, which are regions where there is a high chance of finding an electron. These orbitals are grouped into energy levels, also called shells, which are labeled with numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each energy level has one or more subshells, which are labeled as s, p, d, and f. The first energy level (1) has only an s subshell. The second level (2) has s and p subshells. The third level (3) has s, p, and d, and so on. Each orbital can hold up to two electrons. The Aufbau principle helps scientists understand how electrons fill the space around an atom’s nucleus. According to this rule, electrons always fill the lowest energy orbitals first before moving to higher ones. The order in which electrons fill these orbitals goes like this: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, and so on. This order is based on the energy levels of the orbitals, and sometimes it can seem a bit out of order. For example, 4s fills before 3d because 4s has a lower energy level than 3d. There are also other important rules to remember when talking about electron configuration. Pauli exclusion principle says that only two electrons can fit into the same orbital, and they must spin in opposite directions. Hund’s rules says that when electrons go into orbitals that have the same energy (like three 2p orbitals), they will first go in one at a time with the same spin. Only after each orbital has one electron will they start to pair up. This helps reduce repulsion between electrons. We use a special way to write electron configurations. For example, the configuration for a carbon atom, which has 6 electrons, is: 1s² 2s² 2p². This means carbon has 2 electrons in the 1s orbital, 2 in the 2s, and 2 in the 2p. For bigger elements, we often use noble gas shorthand to save time. This means we start with the symbol of the nearest noble gas (like neon or argon) in brackets, and then continue from there. For example, sodium has 11 electrons. Instead of writing out everything, we can write: [Ne] 3s¹. Here, [Ne] stands for the first 10 electrons (1s² 2s² 2p⁶), and the 11th electron is in the 3s orbital. The valence electrons, or the electrons in the outermost shell, are very important. They decide how an atom behaves in chemical reactions, how it bonds with other atoms and what kind of compounds it can form.

The Periodic Table
thumb|upright=2.2|Periodic table of the chemical elements showing the most or more commonly named [[Names for sets of chemical elements|sets of elements (in periodic tables), and a traditional dividing line between metals and nonmetals. The f-block actually fits between groups 2 and 3; it is usually shown at the bottom of the table to save horizontal space.]]
A long time ago, people only knew about a few natural elements like gold, silver, copper, and iron. As science progressed, especially in the 1600s and 1700s, scientists started discovering more elements and learning about chemical reactions. In the late 1700s, a scientist named Antoine Lavoisier made one of the first lists of elements. He also suggested that elements were basic substances that could not be broken down into anything simpler. By the early 1800s, more elements had been discovered, and scientists began to see patterns in their properties. The big breakthrough came in 1869 when a Russian chemist named Dmitri Mendeleev created a version of the periodic table. He arranged the 63 known elements by increasing atomic mass and grouped elements with similar properties into columns. What was really amazing about Mendeleev’s table was that he left spaces for elements that had not been discovered yet and predicted what their properties would be. When scientists later discovered elements like gallium, scandium, and germanium, their properties matched Mendeleev’s predictions, which made his table even more accepted. Although there were some problems with his system, like elements that did not fit perfectly by mass, Mendeleev’s table helped scientists understand the relationships between different elements. In the early 1900s, Henry Moseley improved the table by arranging elements by atomic number, which solved many of the problems. He showed that elements’ properties depend on the number of protons in their nucleus. This led to the modern periodic law, which says that elements’ properties change in a regular pattern based on their atomic number. Since then, the periodic table has grown to include over 100 elements, including many that are made in labs. It has also become more complex with the addition of new groups of elements like noble gases, transition metals, and lanthanides and actinides (the f-block elements).

The periodic table is a special chart that shows all the known chemical elements in a very organized way. It is arranged based on each element’s atomic number (how many protons it has), how its electrons are set up, and how it behaves in chemical reactions. The table is built to match how atoms work, especially how electrons move around the nucleus. This setup helps scientists understand how each element will act during chemical changes. The table has rows called periods and columns called groups or families. Periods go from left to right and are numbered from 1 to 7. Each period shows how many energy levels, or electron shells, the atoms have. As you move across a period, each element gets one more proton and one more electron, and they go into the same energy level. This changes things like the size of the atom and how strongly it attracts electrons. Groups go up and down and are numbered from 1 to 18. Elements in the same group have the same number of valence electrons. These are the electrons in the outer shell of the atom. Because of this, elements in the same group act in similar ways. For example, Group 1 is called the alkali metals (like lithium and sodium). They all have one valence electron and are very reactive, especially with water. Group 17 is the halogens (like fluorine and chlorine). They have seven valence electrons and are also very reactive. Group 18 is the noble gases (like helium and neon). They have full outer shells of electrons and do not react much with other elements.

The periodic table is also split into four big sections called blocks. The s, p, d, and f blocks. These blocks are based on how electrons fill up different parts of an atom, called orbitals. The s-block includes Groups 1 and 2, plus hydrogen and helium. In these elements, the s orbitals are being filled with electrons. The p-block includes Groups 13 to 18. These elements are filling up their p orbitals. The s-block and p-blocks together make up most of the main group elements, which include both metals and nonmetals. The d-block is in the middle of the table and includes Groups 3 to 12. These are the transition metals. They are special because they can form different types of charged ions and complex compounds. The f-block is at the bottom of the table and includes the lanthanides and actinides. These elements are filling their f orbitals. Even though they are placed separately to keep the table neat, they actually belong in the 6th and 7th rows (periods). The periodic table also shows trends, or patterns, in the properties of elements. Atomic radius (the size of an atom) gets smaller across a period from left to right because the nucleus pulls electrons in tighter. But it gets larger going down a group because more electron shells are added. Electronegativity (how strongly an atom attracts electrons) usually increases across a period and decreases down a group. Ionization energy (the energy needed to remove an electron) follows a similar pattern. It increases across a period and decreases down a group.

Basic concepts
The basic unit of an element is called an atom. An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down (turning into a lighter element, for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay). A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements. In a compound, two or more atoms are joined to form a molecule. The tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid, that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules. Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted. An example would be mixing sand and salt. This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately. Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction. An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate, common baking soda. It will make water, carbon dioxide, and sodium carbonate. This reaction cannot be undone.

One very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions. For example, two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule, H2O. This relationship is known as the "Law of constant proportions" and leads to the idea of "stoichiometry", a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds. For example, in water, there are always exactly 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 oxygen atom. In carbon dioxide, there are exactly 2 oxygen atoms for 1 carbon atom. These relationships are described using chemical formulas such as H2O (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom) and CO2 (one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms).

Mole
Because atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights, chemists often describe the number of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of "moles". A "mole" of any element contains the same number of atoms: 602,214,150,000,000,000,000,000 atoms. The atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole. For example, the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55. That means about 63.55 grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms. The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45. That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it.

Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds, too. Copper(II) chloride is an example. CuCl2 is its chemical formula. There is one copper atom (63.55) and two chlorine atoms (35.45 · 2 = 70.90). Add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound (63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45). That means in 134.45 grams of copper(II) chloride, there is one mole of copper(II) chloride molecules. This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants (chemicals that are reacted) should be left. If too much reactant is used, there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction.

Acids and bases
Acids and bases are a common type of chemical. Using the simplest definitions, acids add ions when in water, and bases add ions when in water. Acids can react with bases: the takes the extra hydrogen from to make an extra water molecule, . The other parts of the acid and base make a salt.

An example would be reacting hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Hydrochloric acid releases H+ and Cl- ions in water. The base releases Na+ and OH- ions. The H+ and the OH- react to make water. There is a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) left. Sodium chloride is a salt.

This definition of acids and bases, called the Arrhenius acid-base theory, is not used by modern chemists. It is too oversimplified for what really happens in water, and cannot describe anything dissolved in another solvent like ammonia. Instead, chemists use the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory and Lewis acid-base theory, which are more complicated but more useful in chemistry. Instead of looking at reactions in water, these theories focus on hydrogen ions and pairs of electrons.

Usefulness
Chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science. Most objects are made by chemists (people who do chemistry). Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances. Chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day.

Safety
thumb|[[Safety glasses give protection to the eyes when pouring chemicals.]]
thumb|200px|This chemist is wearing a lab coat and [[gloves. He is looking at a rock from the moon.]]
Many chemicals are harmless, but there are some chemicals that are dangerous. For example, mercury(II) chloride is very toxic. Chromates can cause cancer. Tin(II) chloride pollutes water easily. Hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns. Some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire. To stay safe, chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab. They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained. The chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly.

 Computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of computation and practical techniques for their application.

Computer science is the science of information. Computer scientists study different ways of reading, using, and encoding information.

There are many different areas within computer science. In some areas, scientists only work with ideas "on paper". In other areas, they use those ideas to make things like computers and computer programs.

A person who works in computer science will often need to understand logic and mathematics.

Common tasks for a computer scientist
Asking questions
This is so people can find new and easier ways to do things, and to use information to approach problems. 

While computers can do some things easily (like simple math, or sorting out a list of names from A-to-Z), computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information, or when there is no real answer. Also, computers may take too much time to finish long tasks. For example, it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA — so instead a computer will try to make a close guess. A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster.

Answering the question
Algorithms are a specific set of instructions or steps on how to complete a task. For example, a computer scientist wants to sort playing cards. There are many ways to sort them — by suits (diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades) or by numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace). By deciding on a set of steps to sort the cards, the scientist has created an algorithm. The scientist then needs to test whether this algorithm works. This shows how well and how fast the algorithm sorts cards.

A simple but slow algorithm is: from one end of the deck, take the first and second cards and check whether they are sorted in the correct order. If they are not, switch them so they are sorted. Do this again with the second and third cards. Repeat these steps with the third and fourth cards, and continue until you get to the end of the deck. Then, starting from the beginning of the deck again, repeat the same steps going though the deck over and over until the deck is sorted. This is called a bubble sort. This method will work, but it will take a very long time.
 
A better algorithm is: find the first card with the smallest suit and smallest number (ace of spades, according to New Deck Order), and place it at the start. After this, look for the second card, and so on. This algorithm is much faster than bubble sort. This algorithm is called a "selection sort".

Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer algorithm in 1843, for a computer that was never finished. Computer software began during World War II. Computer science separated from the other sciences during the 1960s and 1970s. Now, computer science has its own methods and technical terms. It is related to electrical engineering, mathematics, and language science.

Computer science has two areas of study. They are known as theoretical computer science and applied computer science. Theoretical computer science looks at how computers do things so that computers can be faster. It also tries to figure out what the limits of computers are. Applied computer science looks at what computers can do to help people solve problems. 

Computer engineering looks at the physical parts of computers (hardware). Software engineering looks at the use of computer programs and how to make them.

A computer is a machine that uses electronics to input, process, store, and output data. Data is information such as numbers, words, and lists. Input of data means to read information from a keyboard, a storage device like a hard drive, or a sensor. The computer processes or changes the data by following the instructions in software programs. A computer program is a list of instructions the computer has to perform. Programs usually perform mathematical calculations, modify data, or move it around. The data is then saved on a storage device, shown on a display, or sent to another computer. Computers can be connected together to form a network such as the internet, allowing the computers to communicate with each other.

The processor of a computer is made from integrated circuits (chips) that contains many transistors. Most computers are digital, which means that they represent information using binary digits, or bits. Computers come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the brand, model, and purpose. They range from small computers, such as smartphones and laptops, to large computers, such as supercomputers.

Characteristics
Two things that often define a computer are that it responds to a specific instruction set in a well-defined manner, and that it can execute a stored list of instructions called a program. There are four main actions in a computer: inputting, storing, outputting and processing.

Modern computers can do billions of calculations in a second. Being able to calculate many times per second allows modern computers to multi-task, which means they can do many different tasks at the same time. Computers do many different jobs where automation is useful. Some examples are controlling traffic lights, vehicles, security systems, washing machines and digital televisions.

Computers can be designed to do almost anything with certain information. Computers are used to control large and small machines that, in the past, were controlled by humans. Billions of people have a personal computer at home or at work. They are used for things such as calculation, listening to music, reading, writing, or playing games.

Hardware
Modern computers are electronic computer hardware. They do mathematical arithmetic very quickly, but computers do not really "think." They only follow the instructions in their software programs. The software uses the hardware when the user gives it instructions and produces useful outputs.

Controls
Computers are controlled with user interfaces. Input devices which include keyboards, computer mice, buttons, and touch screens, etc.computer are electronic computer hardware.

Programs
Computer programs are designed or written by computer programmers. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language, called machine code. Most programs are written using a programming language like C, C++, JavaScript. These programming languages are more like the language with which one talks and writes every day. The compiler converts the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) that the computer will understand and do what is needed.

History of computers
thumb|right|The [[Jacquard loom was one of the first programmable devices.]]

First computer
In 1837, Charles Babbage proposed the first general mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine contained an Arithmetic Logic Unit, basic flow control, punched cards, and integrated memory. It is the first general-purpose computer concept that could be used for many things and not only one particular program. However, this computer was never built while Charles Babbage was alive, because he didn't have enough money. In 1910, Henry Babbage, Charles Babbage's youngest son, was able to finish a part of this machine and do basic calculations.
Before the computer era there were machines that could do the same thing over and over again, like a music box. People began to want to be able to tell their machine to do different things. For example, they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time. This part of computer history is called the "history of programmable machines", which in simple words means "the history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language."

One of the first examples of programmable machines was built by Hero of Alexandria (c. 10–70&nbsp;AD). He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10&nbsp;minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums. These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when. Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine.

Some people disagree on which early computer is programmable. Many say the "castle clock", an astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari in 1206, is the first known programmable analog computer. The length of day and night could be adjusted every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year. Ada Lovelace is considered to be the first programmer.

The computing era
At the end of the Middle Ages, people started thinking math and engineering were more important. In 1623, Wilhelm Schickard made a mechanical calculator. Other Europeans made more calculators after him. They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris. Because of this, we say they were not programmable. Now engineers use computers to design and plan.

In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted. This means the loom was programmable. At the end of the 1800s Herman Hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine, developing punched card data processing technology for the 1890 U.S. census. His tabulating machines read and summarized data stored on punched cards and they began use for government and commercial data processing.

Charles Babbage wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate. He called it "The Analytical Engine". Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine.

As time went on, computers were used more. People get bored easily doing the same thing over and over. Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again. The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that. It was expensive, and reports took a long time. Then an engineer worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work. Herman Hollerith invented a tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected. The Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation (which later became IBM) made his machines. They leased the machines instead of selling them. Makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them, and CTR's tech support was especially good.

Because of machines like this, new ways of talking to these machines were invented, and new types of machines were invented, and eventually the computer as we know it was born.

Analog and digital computers
In the first half of the 20th century, scientists started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about science questions instead of spending hours adding numbers together. For example, if they had to launch a rocket ship, they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket worked right. So they put together computers. These analog computers used analog circuits, which made them very hard to program. In the 1930s, they invented digital computers, and soon made them easier to program. However this is not the case as many consecutive attempts have been made to bring arithmetic logic to l3.Analog computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems.Some are used to control machines as well.

High-scale computers
Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s to 1940s. Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them. Here are a few of the computers they built:

thumb|right|200px|[[EDSAC was one of the first computers that remembered what you told it even after you turned the power off. This is called (von Neumann) architecture.]]
 Konrad Zuse's electromechanical "Z machines". The Z3 (1941) was the first working machine that used binary arithmetic. Binary arithmetic means using "Yes" and "No." to add numbers together. You could also program it. In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be Turing complete. Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer. It is the world's first modern computer.
 The non-programmable Atanasoff–Berry Computer (1941) which used vacuum tubes to store "yes" and "no" answers, and regenerative capacitor memory.
 The Harvard Mark I (1944), A big computer that you could kind of program.
 The U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory ENIAC (1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose electronic computer (since Konrad Zuse's Z3 of 1941 used electromagnets instead of electronics). At first, however, the only way to reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.

Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as "stored program architecture" or von Neumann architecture. John von Neumann talked about this design in the paper First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time. The first of these was completed in Great Britain. The first to be demonstrated working was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM or "Baby"), while the EDSAC, completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—EDVAC—was completed but was not ready for two years.

Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture. It has become the main concept which defines a modern computer. The technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.

In the 1950s computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes. Transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960s because they were smaller and cheaper. They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on integrated circuits. Microprocessors, such as the Intel 4004 made computers smaller, cheaper, faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, microcontrollers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines. The 1980s also saw home computers and personal computers. With the evolution of the Internet, personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household.

In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) "multimedia computers" and after the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007, many are now starting to add the smartphone category among "real" computers. In 2008, if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, was no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather Nokia.

Kinds of computers
There are many types of computers. Some include:

 Personal computer
 Workstation
 Mainframe
 Minicomputer
 Supercomputer
 Embedded system
 Tablet computer
 Quantum computer

A "desktop computer" is a small machine that has a screen (which is not part of the computer). Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called "desktop computers." "Laptop computers" are computers small enough to fit on your lap. This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games.

There are larger computers that can be used by multiple people at the same time. These are called "mainframes," and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this: the personal computer is like your skin: you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world. A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems.

An embedded computer, also called an embedded system is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well. For example, an alarm clock is an embedded computer. It tells the time. Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris. Because of this, we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed because you cannot install more programs on your clock. Some mobile phones, automatic teller machines, microwave ovens, CD players and cars are operated by embedded computers.

All-in-one PC
All-in-one computers are desktop computers that have all of the computer's inner mechanisms in the same case as the monitor. Apple has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers, such as the original Macintosh of the mid-1980s and the iMac of the late 1990s and 2000s.

Working methods
Computers store data and the instructions as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as binary symbols (1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a bit, which comes from the words binary digit. Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use. A list of instructions is called a program and is stored on the computer's hard disk. Computers work through the program by using a central processing unit, and they use fast memory called RAM (also known as Random Access Memory) as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this. When the computer wants to store the results of the program for later, it uses the hard disk because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off.

An operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results. Millions of computers may be using the same operating system, while each computer can have its own application programs to do what its user needs. Using the same operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things. A user who needs to use a computer for something different, can learn how to use a new application program. Some operating systems can have simple command lines or a fully user-friendly GUI.

The Internet
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication. Communication is how people share information. Computers have helped people move forward in science, medicine, business, and learning, because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other people communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The Internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers. The Internet also allows the computer user to play an Online game.

Computers and waste
A computer is now almost always an electronic device. It usually contains materials that will become electronic waste when discarded. When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for. This is called product stewardship.

Computers can become obsolete quickly, depending on what programs the user runs. Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because some newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so computer recycling happens a lot. Many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs. Some computer parts, such as hard drives, can break easily. When these parts end up in the landfill, they can put poisonous chemicals like lead into the ground-water. Hard drives can also contain secret information like credit card numbers. If the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away, an identity thief can get the information from the hard drive, even if the drive doesn't work, and use it, for example, to steal money from the previous owner's bank account.

Main hardware
Computers come in different forms, but most of them have a common design.
 All computers have a CPU.
 All computers have some kind of data bus which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment.
 All computers have some form of memory. These are usually chips (integrated circuits) which can hold information.
 Many computers have some kind of sensors, which lets them get input from their environment.
 Many computers have some kind of display device, which lets them show output. They may also have other peripheral devices connected.

A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the CPU is like a brain. It does most of the thinking and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides electricity to the entire computer. The various drives (CD drive, floppy drive, and on many newer computers, USB flash drive) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The hard drive is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound, which is like vocal cords, or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are speakers, which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a graphics card, which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.

The most populous continent by population is Asia, followed by Africa. The third most populous continent is Europe. The fourth most populous is North America, and then South America. In sub-Saharan Africa, the largest age group are denarians (in their teens). In north Africa, the largest age group are vicenarian (in their twenties). In Europe, most people are tricenarian (in their thirties) or quadragenarian (in their forties).

Continents
Geologists use the term continent to mean continental crust, a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Continental crust is less dense and much thicker than oceanic crust, which is why it "floats" higher than oceanic crust on the underlying mantle. This explains why the continents form high platforms surrounded by deep ocean basins.

Australia
Some sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents. Others say that Australia is part of a larger continent, such as Australasia, or Oceania. Oceania is a region which includes Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. Australasia includes at least all countries on the Australian continental plate. This includes the islands of New Guinea, Tasmania, New Zealand and a number of smaller islands. It is on the south-eastern side of the Wallace Line, with distinct differences in its biology from the Asian side of the line.

"It includes all the islands of the Malay Archipelago... as well as the various groups of islands in the Pacific. The term has been used in very different senses".

Zealandia
Zealandia is an almost entirely submerged land mass, and 93% of it still remains under water. Zealandia may have broken off the Australian plate between 85 and 130 million years ago.

North and South America
North America and South America together are often described as one continent, "the Americas", or simply "America". This has the advantage of including Central America and the Caribbean islands. Otherwise, Central America is counted as part of North America.

Eurasia
Eurasia is not really an alternative, rather it is a recognition that the landmasses of Europe and Asia are continuous, and some of its largest countries are in both regions. Russia extends from eastern Europe to the far east of Asia without a break. The Ural Mountains, which run roughly north–south, are the traditional dividing-line between Europe and Asia. For many purposes it is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent, Eurasia.

When British people talk about "the Continent" (or "Continental" things) they mean the European mainland. This meaning is not used as much as it used to be, but is still seen in phrases like "Continental breakfast" (rolls with cheese, jam etc. as distinct from an "English breakfast" which is a cooked breakfast).

Continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other. The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now. As these continents push against each other, they buckle and bend. Because of this, the Himalaya Mountains, with Mount Everest, are still being built up today.

Antarctica
Antarctica is Earth's fifth largest continent. Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, covers Earth's South Pole. It has a surface area of ~13.6 –14 million km2: this is about 1.4 times the size of Europe, The continent only has two seasons, a brief summer and a long winter. Antarctica is a cold desert. It does not rain or snow much there. Ever since its discovery in 1812, Antarctica was a great challenge for explorers. Despite being nearly completely covered by a thick layer of ice, Antarctica has a range of aquatic and terrestrial environments.

Origin of continents
A craton is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere. It is the Earth's two topmost layers, the crust and the uppermost mantle.

There are various hypotheses of how cratons have been formed.. Continents may have been formed by giant meteorite impacts in the first billion years of Earth's existence. The question is not yet settled. What is clear is that the cratons are very old, and are the basis for the continents we see today.

Classical element
thumb|The four classical elements.

The Greek classical elements are fire, air, water, and earth. In Greek philosophy, science and medicine, these make up a whole.

Fire is both hot and dry.
Air is both hot and wet.
Water is both cold and wet.
Earth is both cold and dry.

The image below has two squares on top of each other. The corners of one are the classical elements. The corners of the other are the properties.

Galen said these elements were used by Hippocrates to describe the human body. The elements are linked to the four humours: phlegm (water), yellow bile (fire), black bile (earth), and blood (air).

In Chinese Taoism the elements are metal, wood, water, fire, earth ().

Traditionally, only four classical elements were thought to exist. Later a fifth element, known as the luminiferous aether also known as quintessence was thought to be the final element.

China ( Pinyin: Zhōngguó) is a cultural region, an ancient civilization, and a nation in East Aany major inventions. Geographically, China’s longest river is the Yangtze River, which runs through mega cities and is home to many species. It is the world’s third longest river.

Origins
The first recorded use of the word "China" is dated to be 190. It is derived from chīnī, a Persian adjective meaning 'Chinese' which was popularized in Europe by Marco Polo.

History

thumb|left|The Great Wall

Ancient (2100&nbsp;B.C. 1500 A.D.)
Ancient China was one of the first civilizations, and was active since the 2nd millennium BC as a feudal society. Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent writing, Ancient China reached its golden age during the Tang Dynasty (c. A.D. 10th century). Home of Confucianism and Daoism.

Before the Qin Dynasty united China, there were many small feudal states, nominally loyal to the Zhou King, which typically fought each other for hundreds of years in battles for control of China. The majority of these states were ruled by relatives and clansmen of the Zhou royal house and carried the surname Ji (姬), and were tied by family bonds to the Zhou king, to whom they were ritually subordinate, as members of collateral or lesser lineages. A minority of these states, such as the Qin and Chu, were ruled by non-Zhou clansmen, and were awarded their fiefs on account of some merit. Over time, these feudal states attained to power and wealth, that exceeded that of their Zhou nominal overlord, whose direct authority became confined to a very small territory near present-day Zhengzhou. These states also began to acquire some distinctive characteristics and identities of their own during the long centuries of loose control by the Zhou. Eventually, the Zhou kings were eclipsed in power by two especially problematic vassals - the Qin and Chu, and the functional independence of the Qin later led to its gradual conquest of all other vassal states and the formal supplantation of the Zhou to form a heavily centralised Empire.

The long decline of the Zhou, incidentally the longest ruling dynastic house of China, is known as the Warring States Period. Despite the bloodiness and strife of the period, this was the time when many great philosophies emerged - including Confucianism and Daoism as a response to disintegrating central authority of the Zhou kings and fluctuating power of the vassal states, and the general uncertainty of that era. Confucianism and Daoism have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern east Asian cultures today.

Other notable dynasties include the Han (from which is derived the ethnonym the Han Chinese, which is synonymous with the older self-referential term - the Huaxia) as well as dynasties such as the Tang, Song, and Ming, which were characterised by periods of affluence, wealth, population growth, and the proliferation of literature.

During the later years, China was often raided or invaded by northern nomadic people such as the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the Jurchens and the Mongols (the latter led by Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan). One effect of regular nomadic invasion and the collapse of native dynasties was the massive migration of Han Chinese - especially the aristocratic elite and the literati, to sparsely populated frontier regions south of the Yangzi river such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian. Several notable waves of Han Chinese immigration to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian took place during the collapse of the Jin, the Tang, and the Song.

Some nomadic groups succeeded in conquering the whole territory of China, establishing dynasties such as the Yuan (Mongol) and Qing (Manchu). Each time, they also brought new elements into Chinese culture - for instance, military uniform, the qipao and the pigtail, the latter of which was deeply resented by the Han Chinese.

A new age (1500 A.D. - Present)

While China achieved many things in the First millennium and early 2nd millennium, it became an isolationist country in the 15th century C.E. This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent, which was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.

By the time of the Renaissance, European powers started to take over other countries in Asia. While China was never actually taken over, many European countries, such as Britain and France built spheres of influence in China. Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few centuries, by the Qing Dynasty, it had fallen behind other countries in technology, and was helpless to stop this from happening. This had become clear when it lost the Opium Wars to Britain in the 19th century.

Still influenced by Western sources, China faced internal strife. The Taiping Rebellion or Taiping War occurred in China from 1851 through 1864. The Taiping Rebellion was led by Hong Xiuquan from Guangdong. Hong Xiuquan was influenced by Christian missionaries and declared himself the brother of Jesus. Hong made his mission to bring down the Qing Dynasty. Gaining influence on the southern Chinese population, the Taiping Rebellion attracted tens of thousands of supporters. The Taiping regime successfully created a state within the Qing Empire with the capital at Nanjing. Hong called his new state the Taiping Tianguo or "The Heavenly State of Great Peace". Local armies eventually suppressed the rebellion at the final battle of Nanjing.

In 1911, the Republic of China was founded after the Xinhai revolution led by Sun Yat-sen, but its government was very weak. Warlords controlled many areas. Chiang Kai-shek led wars against them, and he became president and dictator.

In 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria, a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was called the Second Sino-Japanese War.

On December 13 of that same year, The Japanese Army killed an estimated (guessed) 200,000 to 300,000 Chinese civilians (people) which is called Nanjing Massacre. The war later became part of World War II. The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed.

However, the Chinese Civil War later started between the Kuomintang (Nationalists) of the Republic of China (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and others. The Communists eventually won the war by uniting all the people from different positions. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.

Under Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer. His attempt at industrialization and collectivization with the Great Leap Forward led to the deaths of many people from famine. The Cultural Revolution caused great social upheaval. After 1976, China underwent market economy reforms under Deng Xiaoping, and experienced rapid economic growth, which made the former progress made by Taiwan became overshadowed. China is now one of the largest economies in the world, relying mainly on exports and manufacturing. China incorporates English, and (since the 2000s) the percentage of people who can speak English fluently is slowly increasing.

Geography
thumb|Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for China
China's landscape is vast and diverse. It ranges from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the north to subtropical forests in the south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern coast. The Yangtze River is the third-longest river in the world while the Yellow River is the sixth-longest. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500&nbsp;kilometers (9,000&nbsp;mi) long. It is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe. The Eurasian Steppe has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the Steppe route. The Steppe Route is the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Road(s).

Science and technology

thumb|Earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the Wujing Zongyao of 1044 CE
China was once a world leader in science and technology up until the Ming dynasty. There are many Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions. For example, papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder are known as the Four Great Inventions. They became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later to Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers. By the 17th century, Europe and the Western world became better than China in science and technology.

Demographics

The national census of 2010 recorded the population of the People's Republic of China to be about 1,370,536,875. About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old. The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%.

language

thumb|A [[textbook 300 years ago.]]
Before 1911, the language was written in "classical Chinese" (different grammar, et cetera). After the Qing dynasty, the revolutionists and scholars didn't like it, so written Chinese was changed quickly. By 1921, the language had been largely written in "modern Chinese" (based on the spoken language of north-eastern China). As for the romanization of Chinese, nowadays, mainland Chinese use pinyin. Taiwanese use the zhuyin (not in roman letters) and traditional Chinese characters instead. The common language is called Mandarin. The Min Nan mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese understand each other. Generally, the degree of mutual intelligibility between speakers of different dialects is low (only understand the other speaker a little bit). A dialect may or may not have a standard writing system.

Chinese dialects
This page only states the six most popular dialects. 5. Xiang (湘语) (36,000,000 speakers in 1990s); 6. Gan language; For example, Mao Zedong spoke the Xiang dialect as his mother tongue, whereas Chiang Kai-shek spoke Chinese with a strong Wu accent.

Culture
China is the origin of Eastern martial arts, called Kung Fu or its first name Wushu. China is also the home of the well-respected Spa Monastery and Wudang Mountains. Martial art started more for the purpose of survival, defense, and warfare than art. Over time some art forms have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor.

China has had renowned artists including Wong Fei Hung (Huang Fei Hung or Hwang Fei Hung) and many others. Art has also co-existed with a variety of paints including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like Big Mak are also praised and talked about within the culture.

China has many traditional festivals, such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most important is Chinese New Year. People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.

Festivals
Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year.

Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the Warring States period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.

Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the "moon cakes." Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.

Politics
thumb|The Great Hall of the People where the [[National People's Congress is held]]
thumb|The Zhongnanhai, a headquarter of the [[Government of China|Chinese government and Communist Party of China]]
China's constitution states that The People's Republic of China "is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants". It also states the state organs "apply the principle of democratic centralism." The PRC is one of the world's only socialist states openly being communist.
Chinese Communist Party

The CCP is the founding and ruling political party of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Established in 1921, it rose to power in 1949 under the leadership of Mao Zedong after defeating the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) in the Chinese Civil War. The CCP operates under a one-party system, maintaining strict control over the government, military, economy, and media. It follows a socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics, blending Marxist-Leninist principles with economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping in the late 20th century. Under its leadership, China has grown into the world's second-largest economy while maintaining tight political control through censorship, surveillance, and a strong security apparatus. Today, the CCP continues to shape China's domestic and foreign policies, emphasizing national unity, economic development, and global influence.

Country
280px|thumb|World map with the current political division of countries.

A country is a distinct territory with defined borders, boundaries, people and government. Most countries are sovereign states while others make up one part of a larger state. The people that live in a country are referred to as a nation. The government that runs the country is called the state. United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Japan, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Portugal, India, China, Bangladesh, etc 

The people who live in a country are referred to as a nation. The government that runs the country is called the republic/state.

Number of countries
There is no universally-accepted answer as to how many countries in the world there actually are. The minimum answer is 195, the number recognized by the United Nations, which has 193 members.

This can be developed on even further by adding the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Denmark. which could add anywhere from three to eleven more countries.

There are multiple organisations, which have their own lists of countries. For example, the Travellers Century Club recognizes 330 countries as of January 2022.

Disputed countries
Palestine is often classified as a country. However, there is an ongoing dispute over its independence with Israel.

There are a number of disputed areas that have declared independence from their parent state and receive limited recognition such as Kosovo, Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Northern Cyprus, Chechnya, Tibet, East Turkestan, and Somaliland. They are just some of the many examples of territories with limited to no recognition that are sometimes classed as countries.

There is a lot of controversy surrounding the above examples and quite often, any of those territories may be counted as countries based purely on opinion. If all of the above were added the list of United Nations members, there could be anything up to 211 countries.

There are, however, many more territories with unique political circumstances that could also be counted.

Depending on how loosely the dictionary definition for the word country is used there could be many more than 193 countries in the world. The matter is purely subjective depending on varying opinions.

Constituent country
"Constituent country" is a term sometimes used, usually by official institutions, in contexts in which a number of countries are part of a sovereign state. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has used the term referring to the former Yugoslavia, and European institutions like the Council of Europe often use it in reference to the European Union.

Territorial dispute
A disputed territory is a territory whose sovereignty is jealously desired by two or more countries. Usually, the administration of the territory is carried out by one of the countries that claims sovereignty, and the other country does not recognize the sovereignty over the territory of the other country. This does not usually happen in land or sea areas such as Antarctica on which no country has effective or total control.

Nation state
A nation state is a sovereign country in which most citizens are somewhat homogeneous in terms of culture, religion, language, ethnicity, etc.

Colchester is a city in the northern part of the English county of Essex. It has a population of 130,245 people. People believe that Colchester is the oldest Roman town in England.

History

Before Roman times, Colchester was Camulodunon. This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos. Camulos was the Celtic god of war. The Romans called Colchester Camulodunum (written "CAMVLODVNVM") and made it the capital of Roman Britain. Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD. The Romans moved their capital of Britannia to Londinium (now London), but Camulodunum remained an important city until the fifth century, when the Saxons conquered the region. 
thumb|left|200px|The Roman wall of Camulodunum, still standing in modern Colchester

The Roman town of Camulodunum, officially known as Colonia Victricensis, reached its peak in the Second and Third centuries AD. It may have reached a population of 30,000 in those centuries, but when the Romans withdrew from Britannia in 410 AD it probably had fewer than 5,000 inhabitants. 

The church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539. This action was part of the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII. Only a gate remains, that people still go to visit.

King Cunobelinus (or "Cunobelin") was from Colchester.

Until 2022, Colchester was officially a town, not a city. On 5 September, Queen Elizabeth II signed letters patent to grant it city status. This was planned as part of her Platinum Jubilee celebrations. However, she died three days later. On 29 September, these letters were publicly released.

Twin cities
Colchester is twinned with the following cities:
 Imola, Italy
 Wetzlar, Germany
 Avignon, France

Cartography
thumb|250px|An early map: the city of [[Çatalhöyük.]]
250px|thumb|right|World map (2004, [[CIA World Factbook)]]

Cartography is making maps. It is part of geography. How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using computers and people usually see maps on computer screens. Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer.

Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin, or as complicated as showing a whole country or world. Anyone can make a map, but cartographers spend their lives learning how to make better maps.

For many centuries maps were usually carefully drawn onto paper or parchment. Now they are made on a computer which makes them look neater with accurate images.

Maps are of two main types:
 General maps with a variety of features.
 Thematic maps with particular themes for specific audiences.

General maps are produced in a series. Governments produce them in larger-scale and smaller-scale maps of great detail.

Thematic maps are now very common. They are necessary to show spatial, cultural and social data.

Creator
A creator is a person who creates something.

In some religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) God (or Allah meaning the God in Arabic) is the most important and original creator of the whole universe - including Man who is made "in his image" (see Genesis) to observe it and control it like God. The idea that anything that a person is creating, like an idea, can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions.

In other traditions (Buddhism, Native American mythology) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the universe. Stewardship of home, land and all of Earth is a test for participating in this, or just good sense.

Chorizo
thumb
Chorizo is a pork (pig-meat) sausage which people first made in the Iberian Peninsula. It is made with large pieces of fatty pork, chili pepper and paprika. The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it. 

In the western hemisphere, the Mexican and Caribbean types are better known. These types of chorizo are made with smaller pieces of pork and different seasonings and peppers are used.

Cured smoked chorizo is edible and can be eaten without cooking. Fresh chorizo must be cooked before eating. It can be eaten by its self, or as part of meal. It can also be used in place of ground beef or pork.
alt=Chorizo hanging in a traditional Spanish market|thumb|Chorizo hanging in a traditional Spanish market
Chorizo can be fresh. Also it can be dried. It can be spicy or not spicy depending on the recipe. There are many ways to eat chorizo. It can be sliced and eaten as a snack, or cooked. Dishes like stews, soups and rice dishes also use Chorizo. In Spain, chorizo is served as a small plate of food with drinks. In Latin America, chorizo is served with beans and eggs for breakfast. To make chorizo, the pork is cut into small pieces. Then it is mixed with spices and other ingredients. The mixture is then put into a casing. Casing is a thin, tube-like skin. Casing is made from the intestine of a pig. The chorizo is then left to dry for a few weeks. By doing this chorizo gets its special flavor and texture. There are many kinds of chorizo. Recipe of chorizo also different in different countries. In Spain, there are two main kinds of chorizo: chorizo de verdeo, and chorizo de cantimpalo. Chorizo de verdeo made with white wine and chorizo de cantimpalomade with red wine. In Latin America, chorizo is made with a mixture of chili peppers and other spices. It makes chorizo spicy. There are a few different ways to cook with chorizo. One popular way is to slice the chorizo and fry it in a pan until it is crispy. It can then be added to dishes like soups, stews and rice dishes. Chorizo can also be grilled, which gives it a smoky flavor. It can be sliced and added to sandwiches or served as a topping on pizza. Chorizo is a tasty and versatile food that can be enjoyed in many different ways.

Creativity
Creativity is the ability of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable, or the process of making something new and useful or valuable. It happens in all areas of life - science, art, literature and music.

As a personal ability, it is difficult to measure. The reason is that we don't understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others. Judging who and what is creative is also controversial. Some people say only things that are historically new are creative, while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them, then it is also creativity.

Some think that creativity is an important thing that makes humans different from apes. Others recognize that even apes, other primates, other mammals, and some birds adapt to survive by being creative (for example - primates using tools). Liane Gabora believes that all culture comes from creativity, not imitation. Therefore, these people say, human science should focus on it (pay special attention to it): Ethics for example would focus on finding creative solutions to ethical dilemmas. Politics would focus on the political virtues that need some creativity. Imitation would not be the focus of education. Linguistics might be more interested in how new words are created by culture, rather than in how existing ones are used in grammar.

Intellectual interests (recognized as intellectual rights or intellectual property in the law) are a way to reward creativity in law, but they do not always work very well. A good example is copyright which is supposed to pay writers and artists, but may only pay lawyers to make (imitative) arguments in court.

Creativity is a central question in economics, where it is known as ingenuity (the ability to come up with new ideas) or individual capital - capacities that individuals have, that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already. This is separate from the instructional capital that might try to capture some of that in a patent or training system that helps others do what the individual leader or founder of the system can do. In urban economics there are various ways to measure creativity - the Bohemian Index and Gay Index are two attempts to do this accurately and predict the economic growth of cities based on creativity.

Catharism
thumb|right|The cathars are expelled from [[Carcassonne, in the year 1209]]
thumb|right|The lower, older part of Castle [[Peyrepertuse. This castle was one of the last Cathar strongholds to fall]]

The Cathar faith was a version of Christianity. They were usually considered Gnostics. The word 'Cathar' comes the Greek word katharos meaning 'unpolluted' (from Tobias Churton, The Gnostics) or "the pure ones".

They used Bible translations in the language people spoke. Most other Western Christians used a Bible in Latin. Latin was spoken only by the priests.

Doctrines
The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god. They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world, but inside their bodies there was a spirit, and that spirit needed to return to the good god. They were famous for a belief in a form of reincarnation and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person's spirit in a new body. They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing. They were opposed to the doctrine of sin. 

Women were prominent in the faith. They were pacifists. They didn't eat anything that was made from other animals, including meat and cows milk. The only exception to this was fish. Fish was OK to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water.

They preached tolerance of other faiths. They rejected the usual Christian rules of marriage and only believed in the New Testament. An earlier 10th-century Bulgarian heresy, Bogomilism and also Manichaeism started some of these trends. 

Problems
In 1145, open challenge to Catholic dominance began. In about 1165, the first Cathars said that the Church was "full of ravening (starving) wolves and hypocrites" and "worshipping the wrong God", right in front of the most powerful Catholics. In 1166, the Council of Oxford in England wiped out the English Cathars. They were also suppressed in Northern France. In 1167, Cathar bishops met to discuss organizing a counter Church - in the South of France, the Languedoc nobles protected it, and many noble women became "Perfects". Parish clergy had low morale, or confidence.

The Catholic Church was against Catharism, seeing it as a heresy. In the South of France there was tremendous religious fervor, and an economy that was starting to grow, and a social class of merchants and peasants was starting to grow. Peasants owned their own land. Meanwhile, in other parts of Europe, peasants were forced to give up their land to nobles and become serfs or slaves - the system of feudalism. There was a strong central absolute monarchy that did not exist in the South of France. The burghers and bankers had more power in this looser system. R. I. Moore is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack. However, there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems: Troubadors, who combined some of the traditions of the Bards of the Celts, and Jews were both part of the multicultural society in the South of France. Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures. The 12th century Roman Catholic Monks were founding their monasteries outside the towns, drawing the best people there.

The Cathars had little competition. The Cathar "Perfects", the so-called Good Men or Good Women, lived restrained lives and spread their faith in towns - where the Catholics in general did not have their best people. Also, Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives - lay people could repent only on their deathbeds. Many 20th century Christian sects have similar beliefs.

The Albigensian Crusade
thumb|Battle of Muret, 1213

Methods
The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France. He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land. This was an absolution of all sin.

In the Languedoc, on the 22nd of July 1209, a force of about 30,000 Crusaders arrived at the walls of Beziers bearing the cross pattee to mislead and create ease among the Cathars, thinking they were friends, not foe, and demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered. The people of the town who were mostly Catholic, said that rather than turn over their friends and family, "we would rather be flayed alive." 

A mistake by the defenders of Beziers let thousands of attackers in. Arnauld Amaury made the famous quote "Kill them all, God knows his own" on being asked how to tell who were Cathars during the assault. Everyone in the town was killed, some while taking refuge in the church. It is guessed that 20,000 were killed, many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all. The crusade became known as the Albigensian crusade after the town of Albi. It was to wipe out the Cathars almost entirely over forty or so years. The Crusaders wanted to go home, but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead. In 1210, they attacked the fortress at Minerv and built "the first great bonfire of heretics" - beginning the practice of burning at the stake that would continue in the Inquisition of the Counter-Reformation. At the siege of Montsegur when the fires were lit the Cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on, as their beliefs were very strong....

Catharism disappeared from the northern Italian cities after the 1260s, pressured by the Inquisition. The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc, Guillaume Bélibaste, was killed in 1321.

Cosmology
thumb|Hubble - infant galaxy

Cosmology is the branch of astronomy that deals with the universe. 

NASA defines cosmology as "The study of the structure and changes in the present universe". Another definition of cosmology is "the study of the universe, and humanity's place in it".

Modern cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang theory, which brings together observational astronomy and particle physics.

Though the word cosmology is recent (first used in 1730 in Christian Wolff's Cosmologia Generalis), the study of the universe has a long history.

History
Until the Renaissance people thought the universe was only the planets up to Saturn, and stars. With the invention of the telescope, we could see more of the universe. Early in the 20th century, astronomers thought the Milky Way was the entire universe. Later, with astrophotography and spectroscopy, astronomers (for example Edwin Hubble) showed that the Milky Way was only one of many galaxies. 

Modern cosmology is considered to have started in 1917 with the final paper of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. This made physicists realize that the universe changed. When a scientific discipline begins to change an idea that is believed by many people, it is known as a paradigm shift. Many scientists debated if there were other galaxies. The debate ended when Edwin Hubble found Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda Galaxy in 1926.

The Big Bang model was then proposed by Belgian priest, Georges Lemaître in 1927. This was supported by Edwin Hubble's discovery of the redshift in 1929. Later the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation was made. This was found by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in 1964. 

All of these discoveries have been supported in the 21st century. Some more observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation were found by the COBE, WMAP, and Planck satellites. Some more observations of the redshift were found by the 2dfGRS and SDSS. An astronomical survey looks at a place in space. A redshift survey is a survey that looks for redshifts.

On 1 December 2014, at the Planck 2014 meeting in Ferrara, Italy, astronomers reported that the universe is 13.8 billion years old and is composed of 4.9% regular matter, 26.6% dark matter and 68.5% dark energy.

According to Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society, the evidence for a rethink of what has been a central plank of astronomy is growing.

"This is the seventh large structure discovered in the universe that contradicts the idea that the cosmos is smooth on the largest scales. If these structures are real, then it's definitely food for thought for cosmologists and the accepted thinking on how the universe has evolved over time," he said.

Church (building)
thumb|A church in [[Ethiopia]]
A church is a building that was constructed to allow people to meet to worship together. These people are usually Christians, or influenced by Christianity. Some other non-Christian religious groups also call their religious buildings churches, most notably Scientology.

The following description is about Roman Catholic churches, although some parts are the same in Episcopalian and Lutheran churches. Depending on the number of people that are in a community, the churches come in different sizes. Small churches are called chapels. The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the diocese. Each diocese has a cathedral. In most cases, the cathedral is a very big church. Cathedrals are the seat of bishops.

In the early days of Christianity people met in private buildings. Church buildings are mentioned for the first time around A.D. 260 when the Emperor Galienus ordered an end of a persecution and to return the places of worship. In the third century we hear of large church buildings. We do not know, how these early buildings looked. Only in Dura-Europos (Syria) a building was discovered, which had been a private house modified for Christian services.

After the death of the Roman emperor Constantine in A.D. 337, Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in. These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman basilicas. This plan was later used for the fine Gothic cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the Middle Ages.

The parts of a church

There are several parts in the architecture of a church. Not all churches will have all these parts:

 The nave is the main part of the church where the congregation (the people who come to worship) sit. 
 The aisles are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave.
 The transept, if there is one, is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church. This makes the church shaped like a cross, which is a symbol of Jesus's death on a cross.
 The chancel leads up to the altar at the top of the church. The altar is in the sanctuary. The word “sanctuary” means “sacred place”. People were not allowed to be arrested in the sanctuary, so they were safe. The altar is usually at the east end of the church. People in the church sit facing the altar. We say that the church “faces east”.
 Churches will also have a tower or steeple, usually at the west end. If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept.

In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of holy water near the entrance of the church. This tradition comes from the fact that Roman basilicas had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance. The font is a bowl where people (often babies) are baptized. This is also near the entrance of the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church.

Traditionally the nave has long benches for the congregation to sit on. These are called pews. Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions. At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest preaches (these talks are called “sermons”). There is also a lectern (like a large music stand) from where the lessons (the Bible readings) are read.

If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be pillars which hold up the roof. In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is called the triforium. Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of windows high up in the church wall.

The chancel is the most holy part of the church, and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone, or occasionally iron. The congregation can see through the screen. On the top of the screen there may be a cross. This is called a rood (pronounce like “rude”) screen. Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the epistle and the gospel. Sometimes people sang from there.

Inside the chancel are the benches where the choir sit. These are called choir stalls. They are on both sides. The two sides of the choir sit facing one another. The choir members who sit on the left (north side) are called “cantoris” (the side where the “cantor” sits) and those on the right (south side) are called “decani” (the side where the deacon sits). In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up. The top of these seats, when they are tipped up, are called misericords (from the Latin word for “mercy”). This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time.

Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through. These are called squints. If there is a recess in the wall it is called an aumbry. It is a cupboard for communion wine and bread that have been consecrated by a priest.

The altar may be right at the east end of the church, but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward. In that case the very east end is called an apse. Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the “Lady Chapel”.

Churches through the ages
The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history. Often churches were made bigger. When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles. These styles vary a lot in different countries.

English churches
In English churches there were several different periods of architecture:

 The Saxon period (700–1050) was a time when churches were very simple. The end of the church (end of the sanctuary) was often rounded. Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of wood.
 The Norman period (1050–1190) came from the style called Romanesque which was popular in Europe. The arches had ornaments which were called “mouldings”. The tops of the pillars looked like cushions, so they were called “cushion capitals”. The windows were narrow and rounded at the top.
 Early English or Gothic architecture (1190–1280) was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture. Towers were elegant and tall, like the tower of Salisbury Cathedral.
 The Decorated style of architecture (1280–1360)was popular at a time when the plague (Black Death) was raging and a third of the people in England died. For that reason, not so much building was done then. There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time.
 The Perpendicular style (1360–1540) was very grand. It had lots of straight upward lines and fan vaulting. This can be seen in Westminster Abbey and King's College Chapel, Cambridge. Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period.

In the 1600s, churches were built in a variety of styles. Often they copied some of the older styles. After the Great Fire of London many new churches were built by the architect Sir Christopher Wren. They were built in the classical style. Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this, but also the Gothic style continued to be used.

Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape. It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel. Modern churches bring the congregation, choir and priests in closer touch. An example is the round design for the Church of Christ the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes. Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches. Many have beautiful mosaic glass windows. Coventry Cathedral is a famous example of a modern church building.

City
thumb|right|250px|View from [[Empire State Building towards Midtown Manhattan, New York City, USA]]

A city is a place where many people live close together.

A city has many buildings and streets. It has houses, hotels, condominiums, and apartments for many people to live in, shops where they may buy things, places for people to work, and a government to run the city and keep law and order in the city. People live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do everything they want there. A city usually has a "city center" where government and business occur and suburbs where people live outside the center.

Definition
No rule is used worldwide to decide why some places are called "city," and other places are called "town."

Some things that make a city are :
 A long history. Although many cities today have only been around for tens or hundreds of years, there are a few which have been so for thousands of years. For example, Athens, Greece was founded in 1000 BC and Rome, Italy has existed since 700 BC.
 A large population. Cities can have millions of people living in and around them. Among them are Tokyo, Japan, and the Tokyo Metropolis around it, which includes Yokohama and Chiba.
 In Japan, the population of a city ( 市 ) is at least over 50,000 people. and among cities, there are various grades according to laws, which the central government of Japan governs.
 A center where business and government takes place. The first case is often described as the financial capital, such as Frankfurt in Germany. The second case is true for different levels of government, whether they are local or part of a larger region (for example, Atlanta, Georgia, or the capital of the United States Washington, D.C.) Cities that contain the government of the region it is in are called capitals. Almost every country has its own capital.
 Special powers called town privileges which have been given by the government of the country or its ruler. Europe during the Middle Ages was a great example of having town privileges.
 Having a cathedral or a university. This rule is found in the United Kingdom. The smallest "cathedral cities" are St. David's and St. Asaph's which are both in Wales, Ripon and Wells which are in England.

In American English, people often call all places where many people live cities. (See below: Size of cities )

Size of cities
thumb|250px|The River Thames is part of London's transport system. This picture shows the "City of London."
thumb|250px|[[Tokyo, is the world's most populous metropolitan area.]]
The sizes of cities can be very different. This depends on the type of city. Cities built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much are much smaller than modern cities. There are two main reasons. One reason is that old cities often have a city wall, and most of the city is inside it. Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow. If the city got too big, it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the marketplace. People in cities need food, and the food always has to come from outside the city.

Cities that were on a river like London could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like Siena in Italy, because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods, as well as for transporting people. London has been changing continually for hundreds of years, while Siena, a significant city in the 1300s, has changed very little in 700 years.

Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large, because the streets are wide enough for cars, buses, and trucks, and there are often railway lines.

U.S.A. usage
In the US, the word "city" is often used for towns that are not very big. When the first European people went to America, they named "city" to new places. They hoped the places would be great cities in the future. For example, Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people. When they started building the town, they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City (for the nearby Great Salt Lake). Now, 150 years later, it really is a big city.

Los Angeles, which sounds like a single city, is really made of a number of cities which over the years have become amalgamated. It now covers a huge area which goes by the name of Los Angeles. The city is governed by a Common Council only since 1948.

Growth of cities
In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger. The whole area is often called a "metropolis" and usually includes several ancient small towns and villages. The metropolis of London includes London, Westminster, and many old villages such as Notting Hill, Southwark, Richmond, Greenwich, etc. The part that is officially known as the "City of London" only takes up one square mile. The rest is known as "Greater London". Many other cities have grown in the same way. In general speech, it is all a city. But, confusingly, that includes the City of London.

Modern cities have many problems. Not everyone has jobs in the cities and they often get money by begging or by crime. Automobiles, factories, and waste create a lot of pollution that makes people sick. Roads are crowded and traffic is slow. The cause of all this is population growth.

Historically, a big problem with cities was the water supply, which periodically got contaminated. That was fixed by an extraordinary man, Joseph Bazalgette. He was the first man to solve this problem, which had plagued mankind since at least Roman times. There are parts of the world where his ideas are still not understood.

Urban history
thumb|250px|Carcassonne is an ancient city in [[France.]]

Urban history is history of civilization. The first cities were made in ancient times, as soon as people began to create civilizations. The oldest city on Earth is probably Catal Huyuk, which existed from 7500 to 6500BC. Famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included Babylon, Troy, Mycenae and Mohenjo-daro.

Benares in northern India is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more than 3000 years. Other cities that have existed since ancient times are Athens in Greece, Rome and Volterra in Italy, Alexandria in Egypt. 

In Europe in the Middle Ages, being a city was a special privilege, granted by nobility. Cities that fall into this category, usually had (or still have) city walls. This shows that security was one pf the problems of a city. The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not. Medieval cities that still have walls include Carcassonne in France, Tehran in Iran, Toledo in Spain, and York and Canterbury in England.

Features
Infrastructure
thumb|A sewer built in [[Ancient Rome.]]
People in a city live close together, so they cannot grow all their own food or gather their own water or energy. People also create waste and need a place to put it. Modern cities have infrastructure to solve these problems. Pipes carry running water, and power lines carry electricity. Sewers take away the dirty water and human waste (see Bazelguette). Most cities collect garbage to take it to a landfill, burn it, or recycle it.

Transport is any way of getting from one place to another. Cities have roads which are used by automobiles (including trucks), buses, motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians (people walking). Some cities have trains and larger cities have airports. Many people in cities travel to work each day, which is called commuting.

Buildings and design
Houses and apartments are common places to live in cities. Great numbers of people in developing countries (and developed countries, in the past) live in slums. A slum is poorly built housing, without clean water, where people live very close together. Buildings are usually taller in the city center, and some cities have skyscrapers.

City streets can be shaped like a grid, or as a "wheel and spokes": a set of rings and lines coming out from the center. Streets in some older cities like London are arranged at random, without a pattern. The design of cities is a subject called urban planning. One area of the city might have only shops, and another area might have only factories. Cities have parks, and other public areas like city squares.

United States politics
thumb|Downtown [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas, is a Democratic stronghold. ]]

Cities in the US are usually very-left leaning. The best examples of these would be New York, New York, and Washington, D.C. For example, in Louisiana, the only Democratic delegate in US Congress who is a Democrat was elected from a district comprising in New Orleans. Below is a list of states and the major city/cities that provide much of the liberal support in them :

 Atlanta, Georgia: 5 of the 16 delegates representing Georgia in the US Congress are Democrats. All hail from districts in Atlanta.
 New Orleans, Louisiana: the only Democratic delegate from Louisiana in the US Congress was elected from a New Orleans district.
 Kansas City, Kansas: the only Democratic congressman from Kansas was elected from a district in Kansas City.
 Las Vegas, Nevada: all of the Democrats in the US House who represent Nevada are from Las Vegas.
 Salt Lake City, Utah: the only Democrat representing Utah in the US Congress was elected from a Salt Lake City district.
 Chicago, Illinois: if it weren't for Chicago, the state of Illinois would be as conservative as Indiana.
 Louisville, Kentucky: the only Democrat representing Kentucky in the US Congress was elected from a Louisville district.

thumb|A man cooking food on a farm
Cooking is a process to make food ready to eat by heating it.

Methods
Cooking is often done in a kitchen using a stove or an oven. It can also be done over a fire (for example, over a campfire or on a barbecue).

The heat for cooking can be made in different ways. It can be from an open fire that burns wood or charcoal. It can be on a stove or in an oven that uses propane, natural gas, or electricity.

There are several different ways to cook food. Boiling cooks food in hot water. Frying (deep or shallow) cooks food in hot butter, fat or oil. Baking and roasting cook food by surrounding it with hot air. Grilling means cooking food on a metal grill that has heat under it.

People often cook meat by boiling, roasting, frying, or grilling it. Some foods such as bread or pastries are usually baked.

Usually food is cooked in some kind of pot or pan. Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire, or by wrapping the food in leaves before they put it into the fire.

Cooks
thumb|A chef at work
A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a cook or a chef. The word cooker means a machine or tool that a cook might use to cook food. Rice cookers and pressure cookers are examples.

Chat
To chat is to talk about ordinary things that are not usually very important. However, important issues can also classify as “chat”, for instance when organising gatherings, meetings or events, such as air show attendance. A person can chat with another person, or to many people. People also use this word now for parts of the Internet where we can talk with many different people at the same time. Usually, people chat on the Internet in a chat room or messaging service like AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Yahoo Messenger Windows Live Messenger or Tencent QQ. There are also programs which let people use different messaging services from one program, such as Pidgin.

Online Chat is real time, text-based, digital communication between two or more parties.

Crime
thumb|alt=darkly shaded painting of two winged angels chasing a man who runs away from a fallen, naked man attacked and subdued for his clothing|[[Justice and Divine Vengeance in pursuit of Crime– 1808 oil-on-canvas by Pierre-Paul Prud'heon|224x224px]]

A crime (or misdemeanor or felony) is an act done by a person which is against the laws of a country or region. A person who does this is called a criminal.

The basic idea of what things are called "crimes" is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person. Things like killing another person, injuring another person, or stealing from another person are crimes in most countries. Also, it can be a crime to have or sell contraband such as guns or illegal drugs. The latter two often fall under the category of victimless crime

When some criminals make money from crime, they try to stop the police finding out where the money came from by money laundering. Men and boys commit many more crimes than women and girls.

Etymology
The word crime is derived from the Latin root cernō, meaning "I decide, I give judgment". Originally the Latin word crīmen meant "charge" or "cry of distress." The Ancient Greek word κρίμα, krima, from which the Latin cognate derives, typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, rather than a private or moral wrong.[

In 13th century English crime meant "sinfulness", according to the Online Etymology Dictionary. It was probably brought to England as Old French crimne (12th century form of Modern French crime), from Latin crimen (in the genitive case: criminis). In Latin, crimen could have signified any one of the following: "charge, indictment, accusation; crime, fault, offense".

Definition

England and Wales
Whether a given act or omission constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission; it depends on the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it. An act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by what are called criminal proceedings.

Scotland
For the purpose of section 243 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, a crime means an offence punishable on indictment, or an offence punishable on summary conviction, and for the commission of which the offender is liable under the statute making the offence punishable to be imprisoned either absolutely or at the discretion of the court as an alternative for some other punishment.

Sociology
A normative definition views crime as deviant behavior that violates prevailing norms – cultural standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. 

Levels of crime
There are various levels of crimes. In some jurisdictions they are:
 misdemeanor - a minor crime, typically punished by a fee or less than 1 year in jail.
 felony (or high crime) - a major crime, typically punished by 1 year or longer in prison.

Different countries have different ideas of what things are crimes, and which ones are the worst. Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries. Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from religions or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created. For example, a religious Taboo might say eating a particular food is a crime. When automobiles became numerous, they killed or hurt many people in road accidents, so new laws were made for them.

In many countries, if people say they made or wrote a book, movie, song, or Web page that they did not really make or write, it is a crime against copyright laws. In many countries, helping to grow, make, move, or sell illegal drugs is a crime.

In most countries, police try to stop crimes and to find criminals. When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal, they usually hold the person in a jail. Then, usually, a court or a judge decides if the person really did a crime. If the court or judge decides that the person really did it, then he or she might have to pay a fine or go to prison. Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be executed (killed). This is called Capital punishment (or the Death Penalty). There are countries in the world that execute criminals, and others that do not.

In many countries, two conditions must exist for an act to be thought of as a crime:
 Actus rea - the criminal did something against the law
 Mens rea - the criminal knew what they were doing was against the law and did it anyways, or they knew they were doing something that could accidentally end up being against the law and didn't care 

Both must be present for the act to be thought of as a crime.

Time Cube
| commercial = No
| type = Personal website
| author = Otis Eugene Ray
}}
Time Cube was a personal website created in 1997 by Otis Eugene Ray. On that website, Ray explained his theory of everything, known as "Time Cube". It described the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry, and time as rotating four "corners". He also said that all of modern physics is wrong. Scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested.

On his site, Ray said that not believing in Time Cube would be "stupid and evil". Some of his comments were racist and discriminatory towards black people, Jews, and gay people. Many people found the site to be difficult to understand.

Ray spoke about Time Cube at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in January 2002.

Ray died on March 18, 2015. He was 87 years old. His website went down in August 2015. It was last archived by the Wayback Machine on January 12, 2016.

Census of Marine Life
The Census of Marine Life was a ten-year survey of life in the oceans, starting in 2000. Its head was Ron O'Dor of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It used data from researchers all over the world. More than 70 nations were involved and over a billion US dollars were spent on it.

It was a major work of marine ecology. It was founded by J. Frederick Grassle.

The purpose of the Census of Marine Life was to say what is alive in our seas and oceans.

Maize
thumb|Zea mays "fraise"

Maize or Indian corn (called corn in some countries) is Zea mays, a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is a cereal grain which was first grown by people in ancient Central America. Approximately 1 billion tonnes are harvested every year. However, little of this maize is eaten directly by humans. Most is used to make corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.

Maize is a leafy stalk whose kernels have seeds inside. It is an angiosperm, which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell. It is has long been a staple food by many people in Mexico, Central and South America and parts of Africa. In Europe and the rest of North America, maize is grown mostly for use as animal feed. In Canada and the United States, maize is commonly referred to as "corn". 

Centuries of cross breeding have produced larger plants, and specialized varieties. Corn has become an important ingredient in American foods through the use of corn starch. People have long eaten sweet corn and popcorn with little processing, and other kinds after processing into flour for making cornbread, tortillas, and other artificial foods.

Maize has been a fruitful model organism for research in genetics for many years: see Barbara McClintock. Research has shown that artificial selection developed maize from a Mexican plant called Teosinte.

The genus Zea
There are five species and many subspecies in the genus. They are all plants similar to the cultivated maize, with less developed cobs. The wild ones are sometimes called teosintes, and they are all native to Mesoamerica.

Civics
Civics is the study of government. It most often refers to studying government in high school to prepare to be a good citizen. In college, civics is usually called political science. Since a city has the most unsimple government problems, the word for this study is like that for city.

Theories of civics can be grouped as:

Anarchist
Capitalist
Democrat
Green
Libertarian
Republican

It contains the rule and regulations of the citizen to make the country democratic

Calculus
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that describes continuous change.

There are two different types of calculus. Differential calculus divides (differentiates) things into small (different) pieces, and tells us how they change from one moment to the next, while integral calculus joins (integrates) the small pieces together, and tells us how much of something is made, overall, by a series of changes. Calculus is used in many different sciences such as physics, astronomy, biology, engineering, economics, medicine and sociology.

History
In the 1670s and 1680s, Sir Isaac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany figured out calculus at the same time, working separately from each other. Newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see planets in the sky, because astronomy had always been a popular and useful form of science, and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for navigation of ships. Leibniz wanted to measure the space (area) under a curve (a line that is not straight). Many years later, the two men argued over who discovered it first. Scientists from England supported Newton, but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz. Most mathematicians today agree that both men share the credit equally. Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton, such as its uses in physics. Other parts come from Leibniz, such as the symbols used to write it.

They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world — Aristotle and Pythagoras came earlier, and so did Galileo Galilei, who said that mathematics was the language of science. But both Newton and Leibniz were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time, and can predict how they will change in the future.

The name "calculus" was the Latin word for a small stone the ancient Romans used in counting and gambling. The English word "calculate" comes from the same Latin word.

Differential calculus

Differential calculus is used to find the rate of change of a variable—compared to another variable. 

Variables can change their value. This is different from numbers because numbers are always the same. For example, the number 1 is always equal to 1, and the number 200 is always equal to 200. One often writes variables as letters such as the letter x: "x" can be equal to 1 at one point and 200 at another. 

Some examples of variables are distance and time, because they can change. The speed of an object is how far it travels in a particular time. So if a town is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away and a person in a car gets there in one hour, they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour. But this is only an average: they travelled faster at some times (say on a highway), and slower at other times (say at a traffic light or on a small street where people live). Certainly it is more difficult for a driver to figure out a car's speed using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock—without a speedometer.

Until calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time. This was a very long and hard process, and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out.

thumb|right|On a curve, two different points have different slopes. The red and blue lines are [[Trigonometric function|tangents to the curve.]]

Differential calculus is also useful for graphing. A very similar problem is to find the slope (how steep it is) at any point on a curve. The slope of a straight line is easy to work out — it is simply how much it goes up or down (y or vertical) divided by how much it goes across (x or horizontal). On a curve, however, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points) because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If this is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a tangent. But there is no way to know (without complex mathematics) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close.

What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly, using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an infinite number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope approached a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. The particular value it approached was the actual slope.

thumb|220px|A picture that shows what x and x + h mean on the curve.

Given a function y=f(x). f is short for function, so this equation means "y is a function of x". This tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x (the horizontal axis) is at that time. For example, with the equation y=x^2, we know that if x is 1, then y will be 1; if x is 3, then y will be 9; if x is 20, then y will be 400. The slope of the tangent line produced using this method here is 2x, or 2 multiplied by x. So we know without having to draw any tangent line at any point on the curve f(x)=x^2 that the derivative, often written as f'(x) (marked with the prime symbol), will be 2x at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation, or finding the derivative.

The way to write the derivative in mathematics is
f^\prime(x) = \lim_{h\rightarrow0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}.

Main idea of calculus
The main idea in calculus is called the fundamental theorem of calculus. This main idea says that the two calculus processes, differentiation and integration, are inverses of each other. That is, a person can use differentiation to undo an integration process. Also, a person can use integration to undo a differentiation. This is just like using division to "undo" multiplication, or addition to "undo" subtraction.

In a single sentence, the fundamental theorem runs something like this: "The derivative of the integral of a function f is the function itself".

Applications of calculus
Calculus is used to describe things that change, like things in nature. It can be used for showing and learning all of these:

How waves move. Waves are very important in the natural world. For example, sound and light can be thought of as waves.
Where heat moves, like in a house. This is useful for architecture (building houses), so that the house can be as cheap to heat as possible.
How very small things like atoms act.
How fast something will fall, also known as gravity.
How machines work, also known as mechanics.
The path of the moon as it moves around the earth. Also, the path of the earth as it moves around the sun, and any planet or moon moving around anything in space.

Coin
thumb|18th century French coin

A coin is a piece of metal that is used as currency, or money. The earliest coins were in Lydia, in what is Turkey today, in 7th Century BC. They were made from electrum, an alloy found in riverbeds. 

Most people use coins as currency. They usually have lower value than banknotes. Most are made in government mints.

Appearance
Many coins have unique or complicated decorations; one side often has the picture of a king or ither important person's head on it. 

The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things randomly. This is called "tossing a coin". A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it. You then look at which side is facing up. If the head is facing up it is called "heads", if the other side is facing up it is called "tails". Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means. Tossing a coin can be a type of gambling, which is illegal (against the law) in some countries.

Collecting

Because coins have been made for a very long time, some people collect old coins. They can be much cheaper than other old things, especially if they are made of cheap metals like copper. Older coins normally cost more than newer ones, but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums, while some Roman coins cost very little.

Conceptual metaphor
A conceptual metaphor or cognitive metaphor is a metaphor which refers to one domain (group of ideas) in terms of another. For example, treating quantity in terms of direction:
Prices are rising.
I attacked every weak point in his argument. (Argument as war rather than enquiry or search for truth).
Life is a journey.
Love talked about as if it were war or competition.
Time talked about as if it were a path through space, or a quantity that can be saved or spent or wasted.

The idea of a conceptual metaphor came from a book by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980: Metaphors we live by.
"The most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought". Donald Freeman.
A convention is to write conceptual metaphors in small capital letters, e.g. }}, with the target domain (idea being referred to) first, here "money," and the source domain (terms used to refer to it) second.

Political metaphors
 eminence grise: literally, "grey man," from French. Colloquially, the power-behind-the-throne. An official close to the president or monarch who has so much power behind the scenes that he or she may double or serve as the monarch.
 figurehead: a leader whose powers are entirely symbolic, such as a constitutional monarch.
 puppet government: a government that is manipulated by a foreign power for its own interests.
 star chamber: a secretive council or other group within a government that possesses the actual power, regardless of the government's overt form.
 character assassination: spreading (usually) manufactured stories about a candidate with the intent to destroy his or her reputation in the eyes of the public.
 landslide victory: a huge victory for one side.
 riding coattails: victories by local or state politicians because of the popularity of more powerful politicians.
 grassroots: a political movement driven by the constituents of a community.
 astroturfing: public relations campaigns in politics and advertising that try to create the impression of being spontaneous, grassroots behavior.
 straw man: the practice of refuting an argument that is weaker than one's opponent actually offers, or which he simply has not put forth at all. A type of logical fallacy.
 spin (public relations): a heavily biased portrayal of an event or situation.
 witch-hunt: the hysterical pursuit of political enemies
 bread and circuses: satisfaction of shallow or immediate desires of the populace at the expense of good policy; also, the erosion of civic duty and the public life in a populace.

There are many more, enough to prove the importance of the metaphor in our lives.

Comedy (from ), in modern times, is an entertainment with generally funny content. It is able to make people laugh. This definition was used for theatre plays, and was first used in Ancient Greece. Aristotle defined this as “Comedy is, as we have said, an imitation of characters of a lower type- not, however, in the full sense of the word bad, the ludicrous being merely a subdivision of the ugly. It consists in some defect or ugliness which is not painful or destructive. To take an obvious example, the comic mask is ugly and distorted, but does not imply pain.” To him, the lampooners became writers of Comedy and the truly artistic ones became writers of Tragedy.

Comedy is also a media genre that is for television shows or movies that are either funny or silly. People who are known for acting in comedies are termed as comedians or comedic actors.

History
Satire
The ancient Greeks had comedies, which were presented in competitions at the festival of Dionysia. 

One of the best-known comedy authors of the time was Aristophanes (about 446386 BC). One of his works, The Clouds was performed 425 BC. The work did not survive completely, but a later version did survive. It is a satire against Socrates, and pictures the great philosopher as a swaggering con artist. Some of the accusations were re-used at Socrates' trial, twenty years later. 

Typical for satire are that the author criticizes society, and living people.

Satyr plays
Another type of Ancient Greek theatre was the satyr play. This was mock drunkenness, brazen sexuality (including phallic props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment. The modern equivalent would be knock-about comedy.

Humour
Humour, or 'New Comedy' is not about criticizing people or ideas, but rather about showing characters in funny situations. The most important Greek playwright of this type was probably Menander. The best known Roman comedy writer was Plautus. He often used Greek comedies for his plays.

Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer William Shakespeare.
Shakespeare's comedy plays include: All’s Well That Ends Well, The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Nights Dream, and Twelfth Night. In Shakespeare's day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes. Instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end. This was unlike a tragedy, where the problems do not work out, usually resulting in someone's death.
The two masks, one was smiling, the other crying, often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy.

Types
Slapstick
There are different types of comedy. One type of comedy is called "slap stick comedy." In "slap stick comedy," people do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows.

Slap stick comedy was used a lot in silent (no sound) movies from the 1920s. A comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was Charlie Chaplin. In the 1950s and 1960s, comedian Jerry Lewis also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies.

Comedy movies
A comedy is a very popular type of movie. Some comedy movies have "slapstick comedy," in which people just do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner. Some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense.

Offensive Comedy
a genre of comedy that existed before the rise of "political correctness" generally racist and discriminatory against minorities but can be used as a way to offend those who offend others this is known as "Reverse Racism". an example of this is calling a white person a "honky" or "white trash" these terms are offensive to white people which is racist but if used against a person who calls someone another terminology, as a way of keeping ones honour.

Parody/Spoof
A parody or spoof movie imitates or exaggerates another person or movie to make them seem silly, dumb, or just plain out of it. 

Different types of comedy movies
Some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies. 
There is a type of movie called a dramedy, which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie. 
There is also a type of movie called a romantic comedy (sometimes called a "rom-com"). In romantic comedies, there is a love story about a couple who fall in love, along with silly or funny comedy parts.

Comedy television shows
Comedy shows are very popular on television. Comedy shows on television are often called "sitcoms." The word "sitcom" is a shortened way of saying "situational comedy." Television situational comedies usually show characters who do silly or funny things which make the audience laugh.

A comet is a ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space. Comets are often described as "dirty snowballs". They are very different from asteroids. 

The orbital inclinations of comets are usually high and not near the ecliptic where most solar system objects are found. Most of them are long-period comets and come from the Kuiper belt. That is very far away from the Sun, but some of them also come near enough to Earth for us to see at night. 

They have long "tails", because the Sun melts the ice. A comet's tail does not trail behind it, but points directly away from the Sun, because it is blown by the solar wind.

The hard centre of the comet is the nucleus. It is one of the blackest things (lowest albedo) in the solar system. When light shone on the nucleus of Halley's Comet, the comet reflected only 4% of the light back to us.

Periodic comets visit again and again. Non-periodic or single-apparition comets visit only once.

Comets sometimes break up, as Comet Biela did in the 19th century. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke up, and the pieces hit Jupiter in 1994. Some comets orbit (go around) together in groups. Astronomers think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object.

History of comets
For thousands of years, people feared comets. They did not know what they were, or where they came from. Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth. They said that each time a comet appeared, it would bring bad luck with it. Whenever a comet appeared, a king would die. For example, the Bayeux Tapestry shows the return of Halley's Comet and the death of a king. Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine. During the Renaissance, astronomers started to look at comets with less superstition and to base their science on observations. Tycho Brahe reasoned that comets did not come from the earth, and his measurements and calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon.

Edmond Halley reasoned that some comets are periodic, that is, they appear again after a certain number of years, and again and again. This led to the first prediction of a comet's return, Halley's Comet, named after him.

Isaac Newton also studied comets. He realised that comets make U-turns around the sun. He asked his friend Edmond Halley to publish this in his book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. Before Newton said this, people believed that comets go in to the sun, then another comes out from behind the sun. 

In later years, some astronomers thought comets were spit out by planets, especially Jupiter.

All this new information and research gave people confidence, but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods. One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that hell was, where souls would ride, being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space.

In modern times, space probes have visited comets to learn more about them.

Cytology
Cytology is the study of the cells, especially their appearance and structure. Cells are the small parts that make up all living things, and their effects on each other and their environment.

There are two types of cells. Prokaryotic cells do not have a clear and easy-to-see nucleus, and do not have a membrane, or wall, around them. Eukaryotic cells have an easy-to-see nucleus where all of the cell's functions take place, and a membrane around them. The main organelles of a cell and their uses are: 
 Mitochondria: produces energy for the cell
 Endoplasmic reticulum: makes proteins and carbohydrates for the cell to use
 Golgi bodies: store and package products that the cell uses
 Plastid (present in plant cells only): contains chemicals needed to photosynthesize (create energy from sunlight); in plants only.
 Nucleus: directs the actions of the cell
 Centrosomes: guides the cell in mitosis and meiosis, the processes for cell division.

Christian
A Christian () is a person who believes in Christianity, an Abrahamic monotheistic religion. Christianity is mostly about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, in the Bible's New Testament and interpreted or prophesied in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. Christianity is the world's largest religion, with 2.1 billion followers around the world.

Other Christians use the word in a narrower way and apply it only to people who actively follow the teachings of Jesus and shape their life by Christian faith. In some Christian movements, especially Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism, a person is called a born-again Christian when they believe the Bible’s message about Jesus and commit themselves to that belief, and are willing to live in ways most people find strange or unacceptable.

There are also differences between major Christian traditions. Many Protestants believe that all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ, whether or not they regularly attend a local church. In contrast, Catholic teaching in the past emphasized that the Roman Catholic Church was the one true church. These views continue to shape how different groups understand what it means to be a Christian.

Who is a Christian?
The question of "Who is a Christian?" can be very difficult. Christians often disagree over this due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters. In countries where most persons were baptized in the state church or the majority Christian church, the term "Christian" is a default label for citizenship or for "people like us".
In this context, religious or ethnic minorities can use "Christians" or "you Christians" as a term for majority members of society who do not belong to their group - even in a very secular (though formally Christian) society.

Persons who are more devoted to their Christian faith prefer not to use the word so broadly. They only use it to refer to those who are active in their Christian religion and really believe the teachings of Jesus and their church. In some Christian movements (especially Fundamentalism and Evangelicalism), to be a born-again Christian is to undergo a "spiritual rebirth" by believing in the Bible's teachings about Jesus and choosing to follow him.

Church life
Many Christians choose to go to church. Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship. However, some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church. Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue, most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ, whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week. On the other hand, Catholics in the past have believed that their Roman Catholic Church is the only true church.

Cheese
thumb|International Cheeses on the board
thumb

Cheese is a dairy product that is made from milk from many different animals' milk. There are many types of cheese, such as cheddar, Swiss, and provolone. 

Many things affect the form, texture, color and flavor of a cheese. These include the milk (cow or goat), if the milk has been pasteurized, the amount of butterfat, bacteria and mold in the cheese, how the cheese is made, how much fat is in the cheese, and how old the cheese is.

Origin
People have been making cheese since before history was written down. It is not known when cheese was first made, but is known that cheese was eaten by the Sumerians in about 4000 BC. 
Classification
There are many different ways to classify cheeses. Some ways include:
alt=|thumb|Some cheeses on the wood board
 How long the cheese was aged 
 The texture of the cheese. These include Hard, Soft and Softer.
 How the cheese was made
 how tasty the cheese is.
 What type of milk was used to make the cheese. This is mainly what animal the milk comes from, such as cows, sheep, and goats. The diet of the animal can also affect the type of cheese made from its milk.
 How much fat is in the cheese
 What color the cheese is (common colors are yellow, and white)

There are also man-made foods that some people use instead of cheese. These are called Cheese analogues.

Constitution
thumbnail|200px|Detail from [[Hammurabi's stele shows him receiving the laws of Babylon from the seated sun deity.]]

The constitution of a country (or a state) is a special type of law document that tells how its government is supposed to work. Every country has its own constitution, it tells how the country's leaders are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in office, how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law, what kind of people are allowed to vote and what other rights they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed.

Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution (see Rule of Law ). On the other hand, countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions, or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others. This can be known as dictatorship or simply "bending the rules". A Constitution is often a way of uniting within a Federation.

The UK's constitution is not written in one single document like many other countries' are. In fact, the UK's constitution is not completely written down at all. Some of it can be found in writing, starting with Magna Carta of 1215 and the Bill of Rights Act 1689 and including more modern Acts of Parliament. Other parts of it are considered common law and are made up of the decisions of judges over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or judicial precedence. Because of this, some people say that the United Kingdom has a de facto or "unwritten" constitution.
 
The United States in 1787 began a trend in the writing of constitutions. The United States Constitution is also the shortest that people are still using, and it has been changed (amended) many times over the years. It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain. At first they had the Articles of Confederation but the Articles were replaced with today's Constitution.

The Indian constitution of 1950 is the longest ever written constitution in the world. It originally consisted of 395 Articles arranged under 22 Parts and 8 Schedules. As of 2021, it has 470 Articles, 12 schedules, and 25 Parts with 5 appendices and 98 amendments.

Circle
thumb|A Circle

A circle is a round, two-dimensional shape. All points on the edge of the circle are at the same distance from the center.

The point on the side. Mathematicians use the letter r for the length of a circle's radius. The center of a circle is the point in the very middle. It is often written as O.

The diameter (meaning "all the way across") of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the center of the circle. Mathematicians use the letter d for the length of this line. The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius (d equals 2 times r):

d=2r

The circumference (meaning "all the way around") of a circle is the line that goes around the center of the circle. Mathematicians use the letter c for the length of this line.

The number \pi (written as the Greek letter pi) is a very useful number. It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter (\pi equals c divided by d). As a fraction the number \pi is equal to about \frac{22}{7} or \frac{355}{113} (which is closer) and as a number it is about 3.1415926536.

thumb|The area of the circle is equal to \pi times the area of the gray square.

The area, A, inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself, then multiplied by \pi (A equals \pi times r times r).

A=\pi r^2

Calculating π
\pi can be measured by drawing a circle, then measuring its diameter (d) and circumference (c). This is because the circumference of a circle is always equal to \pi times its diameter.

\pi=\frac cd

\pi can also be calculated by only using mathematical methods. Most methods used for calculating the value of \pi have desirable mathematical properties. However, they are hard to understand without knowing trigonometry and calculus. However, some methods are quite simple, such as this form of the Gregory-Leibniz series:

\pi=\frac41-\frac43+\frac45-\frac47+\frac49-\frac{4}{11}+\cdots

While that series is easy to write and calculate, it is not easy to see why it equals \pi. A much easier way to approach is to draw an imaginary circle of radius r centered at the origin. Then any point (x,y) whose distance d from the origin is less than r, calculated by the Pythagorean theorem, will be inside the circle:

d=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}

Finding a set of points inside the circle allows the circle's area A to be estimated, for example, by using integer coordinates for a big r. Since the area A of a circle is \pi times the radius squared, \pi can be approximated by using the following formula:

\pi=\frac{A}{r^2}

Calculating measures of a circle

Area
Using the radius: A=\pi r^2=\frac{\tau r^2}{2}

Using the diameter: A=\frac{\pi d^2}{4}=\frac{\tau d^2}{8}

Using the circumference: A=\frac{c^2}{2\tau}=\frac{c^2}{4\pi}

Circumference
Using the radius: c=\tau r=2\pi r

Using the diameter: c=\pi d=\frac{\tau d}{2}

Using the area: c=\sqrt{2\tau A}=2\sqrt{\pi A}

Diameter
Using the radius: d=2r

Using the circumference: d=\frac c\pi=\frac{2c}{\tau}

Using the area: d=2\sqrt\frac A\pi=2\sqrt\frac{2A}{\tau}

Radius
Using the diameter: r=\frac d2

Using the circumference: r=\frac c\tau=\frac{c}{2\pi}

Using the area: r=\sqrt\frac A\pi=\sqrt\frac{2A}{\tau}

Capitalization
Capitalization (North American spelling), or capitalisation (British spelling), is a process to make one letter or more uppercase. The first letter of a sentence is capitalised in many languages, as are the first letters of proper nouns such as names of people and places. In German, however, all nouns are capitalized.

In the Latin alphabet, which is used in English, these are the uppercase or capital letters or majuscules:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

These are the lowercase or small letters or minuscules:

a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z

The homonym "(to) capitalize" is a different word and it means "to fully fund as an investment".

Names of capitalization styles
There are many ways to use capitalization and they have names.

Sentence case

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

Sentence case is the standard case used in English prose and in many other languages. Only the first word is capitalized, except for proper nouns and other words which are generally capitalized by a more specific rule.

Title case

"."

When something is written in title case (also known as capital case or headline style), all words are capitalized, except for certain minor words, such as "the", "of" or "and".

All caps

""

When something is written in all caps (or all-caps), every single letter is uppercase, with no exceptions.

Camel case

Camel case (or CamelCase) is the practice of writing compound words or phrases so that each next word or abbreviation is capitalized. It can either start with a lowercase or uppercase letter. Common examples are PowerPoint or iPhone.

Cuba is an island country in the Caribbean Sea. The country is made up of the big island of Cuba, the Isla de la Juventud island (Isle of Youth), and many smaller islands. Havana is the capital city of Cuba. It is the largest city. The second largest city is Santiago de Cuba. In Spanish, the capital is called "La Habana". Cuba is near the United States, Mexico, Haiti, Jamaica and the Bahamas. People from Cuba are called Cubans (cubanos in Spanish). The official language is Spanish. It is the largest island of the West Indies and the second most populous island (after Hispaniola) of the West Indies. Cuba is warm all year.

In 1492, Christopher Columbus landed on the island of Cuba. He claimed it for the Kingdom of Spain. Cuba became a Spanish colony until the Spanish–American War of 1898. In 1812 Jose Aponte led the First Cuban rebellion against the Spanish monarchy. After the Spanish-American war, it was a protectorate of the United States. It gained independence in 1902.

In 1959, guerrilla fighters led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara overthrew Cuba's dictator, Fulgencio Batista, in what became the Cuban Revolution. The United States had supported Castro in 1958 by stopping the sale of weapons to the Batista government, At first, relations were friendly between Castro and the United States government under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. However, Castro began making relations with the Soviet Union. Castro tried to take over American businesses and land owned by Americans without paying the owners; the United States did not like this. In 1961 Castro officially announced that his government was communist. The new United States President, John F. Kennedy, ordered an attack to invade Cuba. The plan was to take control of the country and overthrow its communist government. The attack failed. The Communist Party of Cuba was created in 1965 and has ruled the island ever since. Today, Cuba is the only communist state outside of Asia, in the Caribbean, and in the western hemisphere.

Culture
Cuba is famous for many types of music, especially dance music such as the Salsa and Mambo. Because Cubans have ancestors from Spain, Africa, South America and North America, Cuban music is special and different.

Reading is very popular in Cuba. Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country, even though the government does not approve of this. They also love music and sports. Cuban music is very lively. This is because a lot of it comes from African and Spanish rhythms. Baseball, basketball, and athletics events are loved by many Cuban people. The Chiefs football-team took at one Football-World-Cup part. In 1938, they reached the quarter-final and lost against Sweden 0:8. The United States bought sugar from the Republic of Cuba at a price higher than everyone else in the world so that Cuba favoured the United States and its industries. Cuba depended on the United States and their investments. Cuba was not industrialized and needed the money for goods and oil. Cuba also needed US money for gas, electricity, communications, railways, and banks. Although Cuban workers had better conditions than other countries in Latin America, they still faced inequality, lack of infrastructure, high illiteracy rates, and a lack of full-time work (the sugar industry was not the same all year round).

Cuban Revolution
In 1959, Fidel Castro led a revolution against Fulgencio Batista. Castro took power in Cuba with Che Guevara from Argentina, his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba. He ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans went to America because of this. In 1961, the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and try to remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The Soviet Union put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Soviet Union removed the missiles when the United States agreed to not continue attacking Cuba and to remove missiles from Turkey.

Cuba became a communist-led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba’s sugar at high prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba’s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world. The army fought in Africa to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries.

However, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to the United States. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power.

In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as “The Special Period”. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island.

In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though Fidel Castro had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro was one of the longest-serving heads of state. In 2018, Miguel Díaz-Canel became the official President of Cuba.

In April 2015, historic talks took place with US president Barack Obama and Cuban first secretary Raúl Castro about improving relations between the two nations.

The trade embargo issued by President Kennedy in the 1960s was considerably loosened under Obama's administration. US citizens can now travel directly to Cuba at certain times of the year. Before, Americans had to go via Mexico if they wanted to go to Cuba. Americans are still not allowed to purchase or smoke Cuban cigars. The cigars are smuggled over the US-Canadian border since they are legal in Canada.

For military service, men from the age of 17 to 28 years old must go into the army for two years. It is optional for women.

In July 2021, there were demonstrations against the government.

Administrative divisions

The country is divided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud). The provinces are divided into municipalities.

Demographics
The population of Cuba is close to 13 million. The people of Cuba come from three different groups. The largest group is the descendants of the Spanish settlers who came to Cuba. The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children (in the barracoon) as New World slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the United States. The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute, the racial-makeup of the population of Cuba is:
 European Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward. Most white Cubans came from many different parts of Spain, but most came from the Canary Islanders, Andalusians, and Catalans. There was as well some French, Italian and English people. Whites make up approximately 30% of Cuba's population as of 2012, and they mostly populate the western part of Cuba, specially cities like Havana and Pinar del Rio. These people brought with them their language, religions, music and others.
 Africans and Mulatto Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of Africa but the most numerous were West Africans. There were also more than 500,000 Haitians that came to Cuba during the Haitian Revolution days. Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the Kongo and Yoruba tribes, there were also the Igbos, Ewes, Fons, Fulas, Mandinkas and some others. Afro-Cubans range enormously from 33.9 percent to 70 percent of the population, and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba. These brought with them their instruments, religion (Santeria), and customs to the Cuban culture.
 Mediterranean Cubans are about 3% of the population; however, one must know that a lot of the southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have a good portion of Moor blood in their family lines. This is due to the close proximaty of Spain to North Africa. Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s-1880s and sometimes onward. These are mostly concentrated in the east, especially in cities such as Guantanamo Bay. They brought much of their foods and cuisines to Cuba and a few words.

Christianity is the most widespread religion in Cuba, with Catholicism being its largest denomination, which is practiced by more than 53% of the Cuban population. Protestantism is practiced by less than 3% of the Cuban population. A large part of the Cuban population is either non-religious or practices folk religions such as Santeria. Hinduism is practiced by 0.2% of the population and Islam is practiced by less than 0.1% of the population.

Health and education
Cuba is a developing country, and, by economic measures, is a very poor country. In some aspects however, like education, health care and life expectancy it ranks much better than most countries in Latin America. Its infant death rate is lower than some developed countries. The average life expectancy is 78 years, Cuba has a 99.8% literacy rate.

In 2006, the World Food Programme certified Cuba to be the only country in this region without undernourished children. In the same year, the United Nations said that Cuba was the only nation in the world that met the World Wide Fund for Nature's definition of sustainable development.

Cuba is the largest island in the West Indies. It has many resources. Only about one-fourth of the land is mountains or hills. Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle. Cuba has fertile soil and a mostly warm and humid climate that makes it a great place for growing crops.

Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba, which is made from sugar cane. Sugar cane is the largest cash crop grown in Cuba, and it brings in most of the money. After that, the second is tobacco. Tobacco is made into cigars by hand. A hand-made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world. Other important crops are rice, coffee, and fruit. Cuba also has many minerals. Cobalt, nickel, iron, copper, and manganese are all on the island. Salt, petroleum, and natural gas are there too. but some things are free that people in other countries have to pay for. The government owns most of the houses. People do not have to pay rent to live in them. School is free. Health care is free. People do not have to pay to go to a doctor or hospital.

Relatives living in other countries often send some money to their parents, brothers or sisters still living in Cuba. Money from other countries is very valuable in Cuba.

Cube

A cube is a type of polyhedron with all right angles and whose height, width and depth are all the same. It is a type of rectangular prism, which is itself a type of hexahedron.

A cube is one of the simplest mathematical shapes in space. Something that is shaped like a cube can be called cubic.
Surface area of cube=6l^2
Lateral Surface area of cube=4l^2
Volume of cube=l^3

Relative 2-dimensional shape
The basic difference between a cube and a square is, a cube is a 3D figure (having 3 dimensions) i.e. length, breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions i.e. length and breadth.
The 2-dimensional (2D) shape (like a circle, square, triangle, etc.) that a cube is made of is squares. The sides (faces) of a cube are squares. The edges are straight lines. The corners (vertices) are at right angles. A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges and 6 faces, as in the most usual kind of dice. A tesseract carries this idea into the fourth dimension (4D) and is made of 8 cubes.

Volume
 The volume of a cube is the length of any one of the edges (they are all the same length so it does not matter which edge is used) cubed. 
 This means you multiply the number by itself, and then by itself again. 
 If the edge is named 'd' (See Diagram), the equation would be this: Volume=d×d×d (or Volume=d3).

Cost of living
Cost of living is the amount of money it costs just to live in a certain place. It is measured using a list of things people need, like food and housing. Governments measure cost of living to give welfare (money or benefits for poor people) and to set minimum wage.

When the cost of living is higher than people can pay, a cost of living crisis happens. Causes for a cost of living crisis can be poverty, people making less money due to inflation, increased cost of needed items, and problems with the economy. This crisis can cause health effects right away and in the future.

December
December (Dec.) is the twelfth and last month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between November (of the current year) and January (of the following year). It has 31 days. With the name of the month coming from the Latin decem for "ten", it was the tenth month of the year before January and February were added to the Roman calendar.

December always begins on the same day of the week as September, and ends on the same day of the week as April.

December's flower is the Narcissus. Its birthstone is the turquoise.

Some of the holidays celebrated in December are Christmas, New Year's Eve, Kwanzaa, and Hanukkah.

The Month
thumb|200px|right|A [[Christmas market in Dresden, Germany in December]]
December is the twelfth and last month of every calendar year in the Gregorian calendar, and is one of seven months of the year to have 31 days. December 31 is followed by January 1 of the following year.

December begins on the same day of the week as September every year, as each other's first days are exactly 13 weeks (91 days) apart. December ends on the same day of the week as April every year, as each other's last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.

In common years, December starts on the same day of the week as April and July of the previous year, and in leap years, October of the previous year. In common years, December finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In leap years and years immediately after that, December both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.

In years immediately before common years, December starts on the same day of the week as June of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and November of the following year. In years immediately before common years, December finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.

December is one of two months to have a solstice (the other is June, its seasonal equivalent in both hemispheres), and in this month the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere is turned towards the Sun, meaning that December 21 or December 22 is the Northern Winter Solstice and the Southern Summer Solstice. This means that this date would have the least daylight of any day in the Northern Hemisphere, and the most in the Southern Hemisphere. There are 24 hours of darkness at the North Pole and 24 hours of daylight at the South Pole.

In mainly Christian countries, December is dominated by Christmas, which is celebrated on December 25 in most of those countries, though Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate it on January 7. It marks the birth of Jesus Christ. Epiphany, January 6, is also important in relation to Christmas. Advent starts on the Sunday on, or closest to, November 30, and some countries have their own related celebration before the 25th. Sinterklaas is celebrated on December 5 in the Netherlands and Belgium, and St. Nicholas Day on December 6 is also celebrated in some countries. The Scandinavian countries, mainly Sweden, celebrate St. Lucia Day on December 13, while Iceland celebrates Thorlaksmessa on December 23. The week after Christmas is spent preparing for New Year.

Judaism's festival of light, Hanukkah, is also celebrated over eight days in this month.

Dance

Dance is a performing art. It is described in many ways. It is when people move to a musical rhythm. They may be alone, or in a group. The dance may be an informal play, a part of a ritual, or a part of a professional performance. There are many kinds of dances, and every human society has its own dances.

Dancing is not a sport, though it does have some athletic aspects. Dance is an art. Some people dance to express their feelings and emotions, or to feel better. Dance can be used to tell a story. In some societies, dance goes with song as well as music. Dancing is sometimes done as sport and has similar athletic aspects. People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools. It may take years of practice to become an experienced and capable dancer. Dancing is a good form of exercise because it is more fun than most other forms. It is a good way to lose weight. 

To plan a dance is called choreography, done by a choreographer. Often this goes with music, and fits into a certain style. Dances may be planned in detail, or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing. However, most dancing does follow some general style or pattern. One style is the couple dance, where (usually) a man and a woman dance together. Other dances need an ensemble, a group of people together to make it work. Some styles of dance are lyrical, ballet, ballroom, tap, acrobatics, jazz, musical theater, contemporary, modern, hip hop, and western. 

History
People have always danced. Many cultures have their own dances. There are pictures, on pottery and stone, which show dances from several thousand years ago, in Egypt and Greece.

Sachs divides early dances into 'Imageless dances' and 'Image dances'. By 'imageless dances' he meant dances which have no set form but aim at getting the dancers into a state of ecstasy. In this state the dancer(s) seem changed, in a trance, and are often thought of (by their society) as being 'possessed by spirits'. These dances are done on certain occasions: marriage, war, famine, illness or death, and so on. They are found in all early ('primitive') societies. In the waltz, and later dances, people danced in couples, but they did so separately. They did not dance in formation but moved round the room as they pleased (but anticlockwise). Often, new dance styles arrive. Some dance as individuals, separately, as they please. Street dance is like that. All these types of dances have music.

At the same time, round the world there are many traditional dances. Some of them have been going for hundreds of years. We call them folkloric dances.

The coming of popular music videos and DVDs led to a kind of dancer previously seen in some stage shows. A backup dancer (or background dancer) is a performer who dances with or behind the lead performers in a live musical act or in a music video.

Dissolution of the monasteries
frame|right|Modern drawing of one of [[Oliver Cromwell's visitors leaving a monastery. People think this could be Colchester Abbey, after it was ruined.]]

The dissolution of the monasteries was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540, when English King Henry VIII took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the Roman Catholic church owned. Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him.

This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the Church of England (which is a type of Christianity). Parliament made the Act of Supremacy to give him the right to do both these things. It was part of the Protestant Reformation in England.

Deadline
A deadline is a time by which some task must be completed.

Very often, it means a time limit that is set in place by an authority - for example, a teacher tells students that they must turn in their homework in by a certain time. This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her principal that every student had the same chance to do the work.

Deadlines may also be set by a time horizon that comes from something that is not a human authority, but part of nature. For example, by sunset one must do those tasks requiring daylight. However, a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight, so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself.

A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the physical horizon where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this. A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things.

Dutton's Speedwords
Dutton Speedwords is a made-up language written by Reginald John Garfield Dutton. The idea of Dutton Speedwords is to make frequent words short, and very frequent words very short. Dutton Speedwords can be used as a second language for international communications. Dutton Speedwords is also a shorthand writing system – this means you can use it to write quickly. 

The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton (1886-1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935. It was called International Symbolic Script. A year later, it was called Speedwords. It was changed in 1946 and 1951.

It has two uses; to be a language and to be used for writing quickly. Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons.

The books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore. But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working online. For example, it makes it faster to type an email.

Another way of writing quickly is Pitman's shorthand. This uses special symbols instead of letters. Speedwords uses Roman letters. This makes it easier to learn. It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard. Each word means only one thing. This means you do not need to use different forms of the same word.

The words used in Speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages. The words are like short versions of the writer's own language.

Devil
thumb|[[Pope Sylvester II meeting the Devil in an illustration created around 1460]]
thumb|220px|right|A common image of the Devil, red, with [[horn (anatomy)|horns and a tail]]
In some religions and mythology, the Devil (also called the God of Darkness or Dark God) is an evil spirit, deity, demon, or other supernatural being that tries to create problems for people and distance them from God. In some cultures, the Devil is seen as the embodiment of evil. He is often depicted with red skin, horns, and a tail.

Some people also use the word "Satan" for the most powerful devil. 

Etymology
The word "devil" comes from the Greek word "diabolos", which means "someone who tells lies to hurt you". ("Diabolos" is translated to the English word "slanderer.") The New Testament uses "diabolos" as a title for Satan, so "the Devil" became another name for Satan in English.

The Old Testament talks about the Serpent and Satan the Evil One, who may be two different characters. "Satan" in Hebrew means "adversary", which is a word for an enemy or opponent. Shaitan is also a word used for the Devil in the Koran, who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing.

Appearances in religions

Christianity
According to the Christian Bible, the Devil wanted to be a deity who was independent from God. Therefore, a war in heaven started and the angels battled. The Devil lost the battle and was thrown out of heaven. Then he started doing bad things on Earth, and wanted people to worship him instead of God. Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises.

The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons. They obey the Devil and help him do evil things. 

In the Bahá'í Faith, the Devil as a malevolent, supernatural entity is not believed to exist. These terms do, however, appear in the Bahá'í writings, where they are instead used as metaphors for the lower nature of man.

Arts
Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil. However, in the Bible, no description of Satan is ever given. 

Believers in the Devil say he is usually a spirit that nobody can see, though he can make himself look like a human in order to trick people. Many modern depictions of the Devil portray him as a red human-like being with horns and a pointed tail, carrying a red pitchfork or trident.

Diarrhea
Diarrhea (DIE-uh-REE-uh), also spelled diarrhoea, happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal. Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other mammals.

Causes
Diarrhea is not a disease. But it may be a symptom of a disease. The most common causes of diarrhea are:
 Viruses, like Norovirus (the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis—"stomach flu"—in humans)
 Bacteria, like E. coli or C. diff
 Some medicines, especially antibiotics
 Food poisoning
 Lactose intolerance
 Artificial sweeteners, like sorbitol and mannitol, which are in many sugar-free food products like sugarless gum
 Other problems with the intestines, like Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome

Child death
In developing nations, diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of death in children under age 5. Every year in the world, diarrhea kills around 760,000 children under age 5. Because diarrhea is watery, it takes away a lot of the water. It also takes away electrolytes—important salts that the body needs to survive. Dehydration is extra dangerous for small children because they have less water in their bodies to begin with. This means they cannot lose as much water as adults before they start to have serious health problems.

Causes
In developing countries, diarrhea is usually caused by an infection in the intestines. These infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. These infections spread easily in some developing countries because of the following reasons: Some oral rehydration solutions have extra electrolytes, like potassium, in them also.

Some oral rehydration solutions come in packets and just need to be mixed with clean water. Oral rehydration solution can also be made at home. If the water in the area is not safe, it can be boiled to make it safe. (Boiling the water will kill any bacteria, viruses, or parasites in the water.) Salt and sugar are then mixed into the water. Drinking this mixture, after the water cools, will re-hydrate the child, if he drinks enough. Adding a banana or orange juice can add potassium to the mixture.

Breast milk will also re-hydrate a child with diarrhea.

Preventing diarrhea
There are some ways to prevent diarrhea, or the spread of diseases that cause diarrhea. However, some of these ways are expensive and difficult to do. These include:
 Making drinking water safe
 Making sanitation better
 Making clean water and soap available for hand washing

Dimensions are the way we see, measure and experience our world, by using up and down, right to left, back to front, hot and cold, how heavy and how long, as well as more advanced concepts from mathematics and physics. One way to define a dimension is to look at the degrees of freedom, or the way an object can move in a specific space. There are different concepts or ways where the term dimension is used, and there are also different definitions. There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts. 

In a vector space V (with vectors being "arrows" with directions), the dimension of V, also written as \dim(V), is equal to the cardinality (or number of vectors) of a basis of V (a set which indicates how many unique directions V actually has). It is also equal to the number of the largest group of straight line directions of that space. "Normal" objects in everyday life are specified by three dimensions, which are usually called length, width and depth. Mathematicians call this concept Euclidean space.

Dimensions can be used to measure position too. The distance to a position from a starting place can be measured in the length, width and height directions. These distances are a measure of the position.

In some occasions, a fourth (4D) dimension, time, is used to show the position of an event in time and space.

Other Dimensions
In modern science, people use other dimensions. Dimensions like temperature and weight can be used to show the position of something in less simple spaces. Scientist study those dimensions with dimensional analysis.

Mathematicians also use dimensions. In mathematics, dimensions are more general. Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the world. The rules for doing arithmetic with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules.

Dimensions and vectors
Vectors are used to show distances and directions. Vectors are often used in engineering and science, and sometimes in mathematics.

A vector is a list of numbers. There is one number for each dimension. There are arithmetic rules for vectors.

For example, if Jane wants to know the position of Sally, Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position. If Jane and Sally are in the world, there are three dimensions. Therefore, Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position. The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be:
 Sally's distance north of Jane
 Sally's distance east of Jane
 Sally's height above Jane

Distance
Distance is how far one thing is from another thing. It is also a measure of the space between two things. It can be measured along any path. Thus, someone who goes around in a circle has traveled a distance, even though his position has not changed.

In geometry, the distance between two points A and B is sometimes written as \overline{AB}. Pythagorean theorem is often used in the calculation of distance. Distance is a scalar, and thus is different from displacement. Displacement is a vector that measures distance with a straight line (and in only one path). Displacement is the shortest way to travel the distance.

Examples
 One ball is 5 feet from another ball. The distance between the two balls is 5 feet.
 John walks at a speed of 6 kilometres per hour for one hour. John walks a distance of 6 kilometres. 
 A circle is a curved line. Each point on the circle is the same distance from the centre of the circle.

Depth
In math, the distance between the nearest end and the farthest end of an object is its depth.

For example, the depth of a box can be measured. When the distance between one end of the box and another end of the box is found, the box's depth was measured.

Depth in Liquids

For liquids, the distance between the top or surface of the liquid and the bottom of the liquid is the liquid's depth.

For example, water is a liquid. If a container is filled with water, the distance between the top of the water and the bottom of the container is the water's depth. If the depth is big, the water is deep.

Dictionary
thumb|300px|Dictionaries
A dictionary is a type of book which explains the meanings of words or, more precisely, lexemes. The words are arranged in alphabetical order so that they can be found quickly. The word "dictionary" comes from the Latin "dictio" ("saying").

There are several types of dictionaries: dictionaries which explain words and how they are used, dictionaries which translate words from one language to another, dictionaries of biography which tell about famous people, technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular subject (sometimes called a thesaurus). Some of these come close to being an encyclopedia, but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things (knowledge) and does not explain the use of the language. An encyclopedic dictionary gives less information about the topic than a real encyclopedia does, but more than a simple dictionary.

Dictionaries which explain the meaning of words
Online dictionaries
 [ TheFreeDictionary]
 [ Longman English Dictionary Online]
Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear "definition" of the word (e.g. hippopotamus : a hoofed mammal with thick skin, large mouth and short legs that lives in rivers and lakes of Africa.)

A big dictionary will also give more information about the word. It will explain how it is pronounced. Usually the International Phonetic Alphabet is used for this. It will explain how the word is used. This is not a problem for a word like "hippopotamus", but a word like "put" has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used. It will also explain the origin of the word (e.g. Greek "hippos" horse and "potamus" river).

A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different tenses, plural form etc.

Dictionaries which translate into foreign languages
There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages. Often one volume (one book) will translate both ways; for example, half the book might be translating from English to Dutch and the other half from Dutch to English.

When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word. A word like "right" has two basic meanings in English: 1) "correct", and 2) the opposite of "left". Other languages have different words for these different meanings, but they have homonyms of their own. A word like "put" has many meanings. A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want. In many languages, for example, the word “put” will be different according to whether something is being put onto something (e.g. a table) or into something (e.g. a cupboard).

Updating dictionaries
thumb|300px|Dictionary
Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes. New words are often brought into a language (e.g. lots of computer terms) or words change their meanings (e.g. "gay" or "cool"). In this sense, the most famous English Dictionary is the Oxford English Dictionary (or OED). Words are always being added to the OED. They are never taken out even if they are obsolete (not used any more). The OED can be accessed online (with a subscription).

Definition
A definition in language explains what a word or phrase means. Defining means giving a definition. 

Other words with this meaning are description and explanation. They describe what a word means and explains to the person when and where it can be used.

In mathematics, a definition is an exact way of saying what a mathematical concept is. It might not be the easiest way to say what it is, but it is used because it is exact. It can be used in a mathematical proof.

Denmark (), officially named the Kingdom of Denmark, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. It is the furthest south of the Scandinavian countries, to the northeast of North America, to the south of Norway and south-west of Sweden (which it is connected to by a bridge). It has a south border with Germany and a northeast border with Canada. It borders the Arctic Ocean, to the north-northwest, the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast, North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the east. Denmark is a developed country with a large welfare state; In 2006 and 2007, surveys ranked Denmark as "the happiest place in the world", based on standards of health, welfare, and education.

The origin of the name Denmark () is uncertain. In Old Norse, the country was called Danmǫrk, referring to the Danish March (the marches of the Danes).

The capital city of Denmark is Copenhagen, on the island of Zealand. Denmark is a constitutional monarchy (meaning the head of state is a monarch who has few established powers) with a King, Frederik X. Denmark is a parliamentary state, meaning the people appoint a parliament to make decisions for them, and it has a democratic government headed by an elected Prime Minister, who currently is Mette Frederiksen since 2019.

History
Denmark was first united in the 10th century, during the Viking period, by king Harald Bluetooth (), who first converted Denmark to Christianity. The Vikings are well known for invading countries. In the 11th century, the Danish Vikings controlled England (the Danelaw) for a while. In 1397 Denmark, Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen (this country was called the Kalmar Union) Sweden became a separate country again in 1523. Denmark and Norway (called Denmark-Norway) stayed united, until 1814. Denmark-Norway controlled many islands in the Atlantic Ocean, including the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. Iceland became independent from Denmark in 1944.

thumb|left|Meeting to write the constitution, 1848
Denmark became a constitutional monarchy on June 5, 1849 when it adopted a constitution which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people. June 5 is now a holiday in Denmark, called "Constitution Day".

Over the years Denmark lost many of the lands that it controlled in battle. Denmark's biggest war defeat was the Second Schleswig War (in 1864) when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were conquered by the Kingdom Prussia (now a part of Germany). This was a big loss for Denmark and, consequently, it began a policy of neutrality after the loss, meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries. Denmark did not take part in the First World War.

On April 9, 1940, Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout World War II. During the war, in 1943, Danes helped over 8,000 Jews to escape from Denmark into Sweden after the Nazis tried to arrest them.

After the liberation of Denmark, one part of the country was not. That was the island of Bornholm. The German Commandant von Kamptz who was stationed there, refused to surrender to the Soviets as the German were fleeing to Bornholm and further to Sweden. The Soviets then bombed the two biggest towns Rønne and Nexø. After the Germans were captured on May 9, 1945, the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6, 1946.

After World War Two, Denmark became a member of NATO and the European Union. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are now part of the Kingdom of Denmark and have their own governments and limited power.

Geography

thumb|left|Map of Denmark
Denmark is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries. The neighbours are Canada (to the northwest) Germany (to the south), Sweden (to the east), Norway (to the north) and the United Kingdom (to the west). The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland (Jylland), the second largest part of Denmark after Greenland. It is connected to Germany and Canada by land. To the south-east there is the Baltic Sea, to the west the North Sea, to the north-west the island of Greenland, to the north the Skagerrak and to the north-east the Kattegat.

The western part of Denmark is the peninsula of Jutland (, pronounced yoo´-land), bordering Germany. This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island. The rest of Denmark includes 77 islands people live on, and many tiny islands. The largest islands are Greenland (Grønland) Zealand (Sjælland), and Funen (Fyn). To the east is the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea, the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen. To the northwest is the island of Greenland, the only place in Denmark where the ice can be seen.

The country is quite flat. The highest hill or mountain is Møllehøj, which is 170.86&nbsp;metres (560.56&nbsp;ft) tall. There are many small hills, lakes, creeks, forests and farmland. Denmark's shore line covers 7,314&nbsp;km (4,545&nbsp;mi). Nobody in Denmark lives more than 60&nbsp;km from the coast. The longest river in Denmark is the Gudenå.

Climate
The weather in Denmark is quite windy and rainy. In the winter, it does not get very cold; in most years, there are only a few weeks of snow. Every ten years or so, the sea around the islands freezes over, but in most winters, it does not. The climate and topography are not good for winter sports.

Most summers are not very hot. People always dress to be ready for rain or wind. There are also very sunny times, but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be. The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Denmark was , on 10 August 1975 in Holstebro.
And the lowest temperature ever recorded in Denmark was , on 8 January 1982 in Hørsted or on 11 January 1984 in Greenland.

Politics
thumb|150px|[[Frederik X has been the King of Denmark since 2024.]]
thumb|150px|[[Mette Frederiksen, current Prime Minister of Denmark since 2019|left]]
Denmark has three branches of power; the judiciary (the courts), the executive (the Prime Minister and the cabinet) and the legislature (the Danish parliament). The current Prime Minister of Denmark is Mette Frederiksen, who was elected in June 2019.

Denmark is a Kingdom which means it has a monarch (a king or queen). The current monarch is king Frederik X. The king does not have a lot of power (he does not make any important decisions) and has a symbolic role. Denmark became a constitutional monarchy in 1849.

Elections to the parliament are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or coalition which gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, several parties who are in agreement will group together to form a coalition government, and the leader of the largest party becomes the prime minister. 

Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Denmark, from left to right on the political axis:
 Red-Green Alliance (Danish: Enhedslisten), a far-left socialist party.
 The Alternative (Danish: Alternativet), a green progressive party.
 Socialist People's Party (Danish: Socialistisk Folkeparti), a socialist party.
 Social Democrats (Danish: Socialdemokraterne), a left-wing party which is "social democratic" (slightly socialist).
 Venstre, Liberal Party of Denmark (Danish: Venstre (meaning "left")), a liberal party.
 Danish Social Liberal Party (Danish: Det Radikale Venstre), a radical left/borderline right-wing liberal party.
 Conservative People's Party (Danish: Det Konservative Folksparti), a conservative party.
 Liberal Alliance (Danish: Liberal Alliance), a right-wing liberal party.
 Danish People's Party (Danish: Dansk Folkeparti), a right-wing political party who dislike immigration (people from other countries who come to live in Denmark).

Welfare
Denmark, like the other Nordic countries. is well known for being a large welfare state.

Minorities in Denmark include Turks, Poles, Syrians, Germans, Iraqis, Romanians and people from former Yugoslavia. There are also other Asian and African populations in the country. Small numbers of Roma and Hungarians live in Denmark. There is also a small Jewish population.

The Danes speak the national language, Danish, which is very similar to the other Scandinavian languages. Swedish and Norwegian are so close to Danish that most Danes understand them.

As well as Danish, most Danes speak a foreign language too, such as English, which is popular as an international language, or German. In the southern part of Jutland, a German minority speaks German. On the Faroe Islands, Faroese is spoken, and people living in Greenland speak Inuit.

Religion does not play a large part in the life of most Danes and church attendance is very low. However, even though many Danes are atheist, 80.4% are members of the Protestant "Church of Denmark" (, The National Church) which is the official "state church" of Denmark. The National Church is Lutheran, which means it separated from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th Century. Other important faiths include Judaism, Islam (the number of Muslims is increasing), other Protestant groups and Catholicism.

Transport
thumb|Great Belt Fixed Link is the biggest bridge in Denmark.
Because of the many islands, Denmark has many bridges. The main parts of the country, and most of the bigger islands, are connected by roads and railroads. One of the world's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country, and there is a large bridge to Sweden also. There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany, but it will most likely be built in a few years. The bridge to Sweden was expensive, took a long time to build, and required much planning by engineers.

There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland. People have to go by boat or airplane to reach these islands. Many islands will never be reached by bridges, because they are too small or too far away. If the island has too few people, bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build.

Cycling is very popular in Denmark because the ground is so flat. Copenhagen is a city that is very bicycle friendly, with bicycle lanes extending over 12,000&nbsp;km.

Culture
The people of Denmark have always depended on the sea. In earlier days, people could not travel anywhere unless they went by boat. Many Danes were fishermen or merchants. Even today, many Danes spend much time near or at the sea.

Farming has always been one of the main occupations. Because of the climate and the soil, Denmark is a good place for agriculture. Export of food to the neighbouring countries is one of the most important sources of income for the country. Danish hams and cookies are exported throughout the world.

Perhaps the most famous Dane is actually Hamlet, the title character of William Shakespeare's famous play, which was set in the real castle of Kronborg in Helsingør, north of Copenhagen. The play was based on an old Danish myth of the Viking Prince Amled of Jutland, and his quest for revenge against his father's killer. Another widely known Dane is Hans Christian Andersen, a writer mostly famous for such fairy tales as "The Little Mermaid", and "The Ugly Duckling". Also Karen Blixen, Tycho Brahe and the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard are well known worldwide. There are many famous Danish scientists, including Niels Bohr, the famous physicist who developed the first working model for the atom, and Ole Rømer, who discovered the speed of light. Hans Kirk, although less well known outside of Denmark, is the writer of the best-selling Danish novel of all time, The Fishermen.

Music
Danes enjoy many different types of music, including ballets, jazz music, pop and rock. Denmark's most famous classical composer is Carl Nielsen. Famous Danish bands include Aqua, a pop band, and The Raveonettes, an indie rock band. The most famous Danish rock star is Lars Ulrich of the band Metallica.

Food
thumb|170px|Danish open sandwich ([[smørrebrød) on dark rye bread. A popular food item in Denmark.]]
The cuisine of Denmark shares much with the other Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden) as well as northern Germany. Common meats are pork and fish. Traditional Danish food includes frikadeller (fried meatballs, often served with potatoes and various sorts of gravy). Fish is widely eaten, especially on the west coast of Jutland.

Holidays
Christmas () is the main feast of the year. Christmas is traditionally celebrated on the eve, December 24, and this is when the main Christmas meal is eaten and presents are unwrapped.

In midwinter, a fast is celebrated. Children are dressed up, and go from house to house begging for money. This practice has in the recent years been taken over by Halloween, and most people give candy not money. A barrel filled with candy is smashed with clubs. The person who makes the candy fall out is appointed queen of cats and the person who hits the last stick is appointed king of cats.

Midsummer is celebrated with a huge bonfire in the evening of June 23. Most Danes have a three-week summer holiday in July or August.

Sports
The most popular sport in Denmark is football (soccer). Sailing, swimming and other water sports are very popular because of the long coastline. Another common sport is cycling, (Copenhagen has been nicknamed the "City of Cyclists" because of the popularity of bicycles for moving around), which has become popular in Denmark partly because of the flat land all over the country. Indoor sports such as badminton and handball are also popular during the long winters.

Monarchy

Death
alt=|thumb|Death and his flowers, in Kuoleman puutarha, Hugo Simberg (1906)
thumb|upright|200px|The human [[skull is often used as a symbol for death]]
Death is the end of a life in an organism. All biological and living activity of the living thing stops, including the mind and the senses. The usual signal for death in humans and many other animals is that the heart stops beating and cannot be restarted. This can be caused by many things. All living things have a limited lifespan, and all living things eventually die.

Living things that have died are normally described as being dead. Death of humans is often investigated for the cause, in case of crime (such as murder), accident or disease that may continue to kill other humans. About 150,000 people die every day around the world. About two thirds of these people die because of age. 

Dealing with dead bodies and their property

Finding the cause of any human death and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into human morbidity or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an autopsy. Some religions do not allow autopsies, because they feel the body is holy. Autopsies are usually required by the state if someone dies and people do not know why. The autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose, tried to hurt them, or if they died from a sickness.

To prepare for their own death, humans can write a last will and testament to be clear about who gets their property and possessions. A person will sometimes also volunteer to be an organ donor. This might mean giving the whole body to medical research. It can also save the lives of others by making organ transplants possible.

Religious views of death

For a long time, many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die. This is one of the largest questions of philosophy and religion. Many people believe there is some form of afterlife.

Ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies, and much property, but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral. 

Christianity has a special focus on death because of the state killing of Jesus Christ by the Romans. In Islam this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death, and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it. In Christianity itself it is thought to prove that Jesus himself was really God and so could lose his body and still have the power of resurrection. In Buddhism reincarnation is believed to occur. Reincarnation is an idea taken from Hinduism.

Confucianism advises respect for parents and forms of ancestor worship to respect both dead and living ancestors.

Rituals surrounding death

Every ethical tradition including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death. Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual. For instance, one may say that organ transplant is like cannibalism.

Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual. People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way, and who wish a particular treatment like cremation of their body, should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements. This makes it much easier for their family after they die, since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish.

For the same reason, saying goodbye is important. Most of the stress of death seems to come for loved ones who "did not have a chance to say goodbye".

Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created, and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves, can be exchanged by others.

Some ritual, such as seances, claim to allow people to speak to the dead. This is not claimed to be very reliable, both by scientists and even by those who do them very often.

Preparing for death

Aside from wills, goodbyes, organ donations and funerals, there is important personal experience to decide to pass on, or not, when someone knows they may soon die. Palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives, and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them. It is a replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no quality of life. Human psychology must prepare for death if it is anything other than a quick surprise:

Elizabeth Kubler-Ross wrote that there were several stages in dying, of which denial was the first, and acceptance was the last. Recording one's life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave a memoir or a full autobiography:

Because events leave living memory, and may only be part of oral tradition, there are projects to record everything that people remember about World War I and the Shoah. The first of these was to record everything remembered about the U.S. Civil War. This discipline has changed history since we have so many more first person accounts of the times, and made social history much more standard.

Other terms for death
There are other terms for death. Examples are, "to pass away", "to go to a better place", "to buy the farm" (generally used in the military), "to leave the earth", "big sleep", and "to kick the bucket". the term gone may also be a term for describing death. for example: if a person has died, they are also said to be gone, as in gone to a better place or no longer here.

Death is often considered as inevitable, and as "the beginning of a new life" extending beyond human existence.

Unnatural causes of death
Old age and illness are not the only things that can end a person's life. People make other people die. This is called killing or murder. Three famous murders are John Wilkes Booth killing Abraham Lincoln, James Earl Ray killing Martin Luther King Jr. and Lee Harvey Oswald killing the President of the United States John F. Kennedy. People can also die by accidents resulting in terminal trauma, hypothermia, starvation, suicide and dehydration.

Diesel-electric
A diesel-electric engine is a diesel generator, a diesel engine that drives an electric generator. The generator feeds electric power to an electric motor which turns a driveshaft. Its efficiency is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through gears. Most locomotives and many ships use diesel-electric drive.

Many diesel-electric drives, especially small ones, store the electricity in a battery. Some designs also store braking energy in a flywheel, which can also charge a battery. However, these add even more complexity and weight to the vehicle, so are more appropriate for city driving where service stations are always available and there is much stop and go driving.

Because they do not require any change or investment in stations nor much in vehicle design, diesel-electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today's internal combustion engine. When properly tuned, they have low emissions and they use only about one-third of the fossil fuel of most gasoline engines powering similar vehicles.

Honda and Toyota are presently delivering consumer priced diesel-electric cars. By contrast, hydrogen infrastructure is thought to be decades off, and is not fully implemented even in Iceland where there is abundant free geothermal electricity.

In countries like India, government is focusing on fully electric trains rather than diesel electric. That too electricity will be produced by renewable sources like Solar.

Many activists feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall, a way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel-electric vehicles in the nearer term.

Embassy
thumb|250px|right| The [[Germany|German embassy in Riga]]

A foreign embassy is the official office of one country in another. It is usually in the capital city of the other country. It is where the ambassador and other representatives of the home country work. Much of the diplomacy (talk) between the two governments happens there. They represent their country to the host government. The embassy represents the interests of the entire country and is fully responsible for the relationship between the two countries. 

The head of the embassy is usually an ambassador, but can also be a minister, high commissioner, or other level of diplomatic personnel appointed by the sending country to represent it.

Europe
thumb|275px|[[Map of Europe]]
thumb|275px|right|The languages of Europe
thumb|275px|Europe history; [[1000.]]

Europe is the western part of the continent of Eurasia, often thought of as its own continent. It is separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains in Russia and the Bosporus strait in Turkey.

Europe is bordered by water on three sides. On the west is the Atlantic Ocean. To the north is the Arctic Ocean. The Mediterranean Sea separates Southeastern Europe from the continent of Africa. On the eastern border of Europe are the Ural River and Ural Mountains.

There are at least 44 or 50 countries in Europe (the European identities of 7 countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey are disputed). Most of these countries are members of the European Union.

Europe covers about 10,180,000 square kilometre (3,930,000 square miles). This is 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of its land area).

As of 2017, about 510 million people lived in Europe.

Europe contains the world's second most-active volcano, which is Mount Etna that is currently the most-active volcano in the continent.

Europe is a major tourist attraction. People come from all over the world to see its many World Heritage Sites and other attractions. The continent has the largest Roma population in the world.

Origin of name
Europe is named after a princess in Greek mythology called "Europa." The myth says that Zeus kidnapped Europa and took her to Crete, where she became the mother of King Minos (from whom Europe’s first civilization gets its name, the Minoans).

The name "Europa" was later used to describe Greece. Then, as the rest of modern-day Europe started to have cities and empires, the entire area West of the Ural Mountains came to be called "Europa".

History

The history of Europe is long and has many turns. Many great countries originated from Europe. Greek mythology and the beginning of western civilization came from European nations.

Some of the major periods in European history have been:
 Ancient Greece (Minoan, Mycenaean, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic): c.2000 BC to 146 BC
 Ancient Rome (Roman kingdom, Roman Republic and Roman Empire): 753BC-476
 Middle Ages (Early, High, Late): 476 to 1492
 Early Modern Era (Renaissance, Reformation, Age of Discovery, Enlightenment): 1492-1789
 19th Century, 20th Century and 21st Century (French Revolution, Napoleonic Wars, Industrial Revolution, Colonialism, World War 1, October Revolution, World War 2, Cold War): 1789-present.

Regions and countries
Andreas M. Kaplan describes modern Europe as a continent where many different cultures live closely together, "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".

There are several major regions of Europe:
 Eastern Europe
 Central Europe
 Western Europe
 Northern Europe
 Southern and Southeastern Europe
Within these regions, there are up to 50 independent European countries (with the identities of 7 transcontinental countries being disputed). The largest is the Russian Federation, which covers 39% of Europe.

The largest cities in Europe are Istanbul, Moscow, London, St. Petersburg and Berlin. The country with the largest population is the Russian Federation. About 15% of Europeans live in Russia.

Two European countries, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, are on islands called the British Isles.

Climate
Most of Europe lies in temperate climate zones.

However, there are many different climates throughout Europe. For example, during the winter, it may be snowing and -30 degrees Celsius for 4–5 months in the north of Europe. Yet it may be much warmer, with no snow at all except on high mountains, in Spain.

European organizations
 European Union
 Council of Europe
 European Court of Human Rights
 Union of European Football Associations
 Warsaw Pact Organization (1955-1989)

European Union

The European Union is a confederation of 27 European countries. These countries agree to follow common laws so that their citizens can move and trade in EU countries almost the same as they do in their own. Twenty of these countries also share the same type of money: the euro.

Encyclopedia
An encyclopedia is a collection, usually a book or website, of information. Some are known as encyclopedic dictionaries.An encyclopedia contains a lot of information.

thumb|250px|[[Encyclopædia Britannica|alt=33 books of the Encyclopædia Britannica in two rows in a bookshelf.]]

History
Overview
All encyclopedias were printed, until the late 20th century, when some were on CDs and the internet. 21st century encyclopedias are mostly online by internet. The largest encyclopedia in the English language is English Wikipedia, which has more than 6 million articles. The second largest is the Encyclopædia Britannica, which is the largest one that is printed. Either kind of encyclopedia can inform us on various topics.
Ancient times
Book series were used to summarize all knowledge have been published for thousands of years. A famous early one was called Natural History by Pliny the Elder. The name "encyclopedia" is from the 16th century and meant "complete knowledge". The French Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot was the first that had major parts written by many people from all around the world.
Modern times
After the printing press was invented, dictionaries with long definitions began to be called encyclopedias that were books that has articles or subjects For example, a dictionary of science, if it included essays or paragraphs, it was thought of as an encyclopedia or knowledgeable book on the subject of science. Some encyclopedias then put essays on more than one subject in alphabetical order instead of grouping them together by subject. The word, encyclopedia, was put in the title of some encyclopedias.
Publishers
Companies such as Britannica were started for the purpose of publishing encyclopedias for sale to individuals, and for public use in libraries. Akin to dictionaries, these publishers hired hundreds of experts to write articles. Some internet encyclopedias allowed their paying customers to submit articles from other encyclopedias. Other internet encyclopedias accepted writing from non-paying users – users not signed in – of the encyclopedia.

Types of encyclopedias
There are different types of encyclopedias. Some are general and have pages on lots of topics. The English language Encyclopædia Britannica and German Brockhaus are general encyclopedias. Some are about specific topics. 
Examples
Specialized encyclopedias
There are encyclopedias of medicine or philosophy. Others include the Dictionary of National Biography, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, and Black's Law Dictionary. There are also encyclopedias that cover many topics with one perspective or one cultural bias, including the Conservapedia and Great Soviet Encyclopedia.

There are two main ways of organizing printed encyclopedias: from A to Z or by categories. Most encyclopedias go by A to Z. Many dictionaries have similar information to encyclopedias.

Earth science
thumb|250px|A [[volcano eruption is the release of stored energy from below the surface of Earth. The heat comes mostly from radioactive decay, and convection, in the Earth's core and mantle.]]

Earth science is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth. Earth science may also be called geoscience. Geoscience is the study of the architecture of the Earth.

It is a broader term than geology because it includes aspects of planetary science, which is part of astronomy. The Earth sciences include the study of the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists use ideas from physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to understand the Earth, and how it evolved to its current state.

If there is one fact which underlies all Earth science it is this: the Earth is an ancient planet which has been changing the whole time since its formation. The extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think.

Main Branches of Earth Science
thumb|[[The Blue Marble, Apollo 17, December 1972]]
Earth science is the study of the Earth, how it works, what it is made of, and how its systems interact. It includes many different types of science that work together to explain everything from rocks beneath our feet to the space around our planet. Earth science helps us understand natural events like earthquakes and weather patterns, and it also helps us solve problems like pollution or climate change. These areas of science often overlap. For example, to fully understand a volcanic eruption, scientists might use knowledge from geology, atmospheric science, geophysics, and geochemistry. There are several major branches of Earth science. These include Geology (the study of Earth's solid parts), Oceanography (the study of oceans), Meteorology or Atmospheric science (the study of the atmosphere and weather), Astronomy (especially how space affects Earth), Environmental science (how humans interact with Earth), Physical geography (how natural landscapes form and change), Geophysics (the physics of Earth’s interior and surface), and Geochemistry (the chemistry of Earth’s materials). Even though these are separate fields, they often work together to help us understand Earth as one large, connected system.

Geology is the main branch of Earth science and focuses on Earth’s solid parts. Geologists study things like rocks, minerals, and mountains, as well as processes such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and landslides. They use tools like maps, satellite images, and underground exploration methods to learn about what’s happening below the surface. Geologists also look at fossils to learn about life in the past and use the geologic time scale to organize Earth’s long history. There are different areas within geology. Petrology focuses on rocks, stratigraphy studies layers of rock, and paleontology looks at ancient life through fossils. Geologists also help us prepare for natural hazards by studying where earthquakes are likely to happen or when a volcano might erupt. For example, the Himalayas are still rising today because of plate tectonics, the movement of Earth’s outer shell. Areas around the Pacific Ocean, known as the Ring of Fire, have many earthquakes and volcanoes for the same reason. Another important part of geology is economic geology, which focuses on finding useful resources like coal, oil, metals, and rare earth elements. These are important for things like building technology and producing energy.

Oceanography is the science that studies Earth’s oceans, which cover more than 70% of the planet’s surface. Oceans are very important because they affect climate, weather, and life on Earth. Oceanographers learn about the oceans in four main areas: physical, chemical, biological, and geological oceanography. Each area looks at different parts of how the ocean works and how it connects with the rest of the Earth. Physical oceanographers study how water moves through the ocean. They look at waves, currents, and how the ocean and atmosphere affect each other. One example is El Niño, which is a change in ocean temperatures that affects weather all over the world. Another important topic is thermohaline circulation, a system of ocean currents that moves heat around the planet and helps control global climate. Chemical oceanographers focus on what the ocean is made of. They study things like salinity (how salty the water is), nutrient cycles, and how gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) affect the ocean. One major issue is ocean acidification, which happens when too much CO₂ is absorbed by the ocean, making the water more acidic. This can harm animals like corals and shellfish that rely on calcium carbonate to build their shells. Biological oceanographers study the plants and animals that live in the ocean, from tiny plankton to huge whales. They explore all kinds of environments, like coral reefs and the deep sea, to learn how marine life survives and interacts. This helps us protect biodiversity and understand the ocean’s role in the food chain. Geological oceanographers look at the shape and structure of the ocean floor. They study underwater features like mid-ocean ridges, hydrothermal vents, and submarine canyons. These features tell us how the Earth’s crust moves and how new seafloor is formed through a process called seafloor spreading. Scientists use high-tech tools like underwater robots (AUVs), satellites, and deep-sea drilling platforms to explore these areas.

Meteorology, also known as atmospheric science, is the study of the Earth’s atmosphere and how it controls weather and climate. Meteorologists collect data on things like temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind to understand how weather works and to make forecasts. Tools like weather balloons, Doppler radar, and computer models help scientists predict weather days in advance. Meteorology is especially important for understanding extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, and heat waves. These events can cause a lot of damage to people, animals, and the environment, so being able to predict them can help keep communities safe. A special part of meteorology is climate science, which studies long-term weather patterns and how they are changing. Scientists look at how greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, and aerosols in the atmosphere are causing global warming and melting polar ice. Another branch, called paleoclimatology, uses clues from ice cores, tree rings, and sediment layers to learn about climates from thousands of years ago. This information helps us understand what might happen to Earth’s climate in the future. One interesting area of research is how the jet stream, a fast-moving ribbon of air high above Earth, affects weather. Scientists are also studying how changes in the polar vortex, a group of cold winds near the poles, might lead to unusual cold weather in places like North America and Europe. This helps us better understand the connection between global climate and local weather.

Astronomy, when studied as part of Earth science, looks at how things in space affect our planet. This includes the Sun, the Moon, and other objects in the solar system. For example, Earth’s orbit, tilt, and a slow wobble called precession help create the seasons and affect climate patterns over thousands of years. These long-term changes are called the Milankovitch cycles, and they help explain ice ages in Earth's history. The Sun’s activity can also affect life on Earth. Events like sunspots and solar flares can change the amount of energy Earth receives. Strong solar flares can disturb Earth's magnetic field, which may damage satellites, affect GPS signals, and even cause problems with electric power grids. Astronomers also study meteoroids and asteroids, especially because impacts from space rocks have caused major events in Earth’s past, such as the asteroid that likely led to the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. A special field called planetary geology compares Earth to other planets and moons. This helps scientists understand how volcanoes, earthquakes, and surface changes work not just on Earth, but also on places like Mars or the Moon. The Moon also plays a big role in our daily lives. Its gravity causes ocean tides, and its steady pull helps keep Earth’s axial tilt stable, which is important for long-term climate balance.

Environmental science is the study of how humans interact with the natural world. It brings together different sciences like biology, chemistry, and geology, as well as social science, to understand and solve environmental problems. Environmental scientists look at how human activities affect air, water, soil, and ecosystems. Some of the big issues they study include pollution, climate change, and how to manage natural resources wisely. For example, when harmful substances like mercury build up in fish, it can affect the entire food chain. Another problem is eutrophication, which happens when too many nutrients like fertilizer enter lakes and rivers. This causes too much algae to grow, which uses up oxygen and harms fish and other animals. Environmental scientists use tools like satellites, maps, and computer models to track changes and predict future problems. They also study the life cycle of pollutants, how they move through air, water, and soil. They also try to find ways to reduce or clean them up. Their work helps governments create rules and policies to protect the environment, like the Clean Air Act, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, which aim to reduce pollution and fight global warming.

Physical geography is the study of the natural features and physical processes on Earth’s surface. This branch of science looks at landforms (like mountains, valleys, and rivers), climate zones (such as tropical or polar areas), ecosystems, soils, and water systems. Physical geographers want to understand how these features form, change over time, and interact with each other. They use special tools like GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and remote sensing (satellite images) to map and study patterns on Earth. For example, they might track deforestation in the Amazon rainforest or desertification (land turning to desert) in areas like the Sahel region in Africa. There are several subfields in physical geography. Geomorphology focuses on how landforms are created and shaped by forces like wind, water, and ice. Hydrology studies how water moves through the environment, including rivers, lakes, and underground water. Climatology looks at weather patterns and climate zones in different places. Physical geographers also study how human activities affect nature. For instance, cities often become urban heat islands, where temperatures are higher because of buildings and roads. River management, such as building dams or levees, can change how floodplains work and affect local plants and animals. Another key idea is ecotones, which are areas where different ecosystems meet. These zones usually have rich biodiversity. Physical geography helps in planning for natural disasters and protecting the environment.

Geophysics is the science that uses physics to study Earth’s inside and its physical properties. Geophysicists try to understand what is going on below Earth’s surface without digging deep holes. One major area is seismology, which uses vibrations from earthquakes (called seismic waves) to learn about Earth’s internal layers like the crust, mantle, and core. Another area is gravimetry, which measures small changes in Earth’s gravity to find things underground, such as oil, minerals, or caves. Magnetometry maps changes in Earth’s magnetic field and can be used to find mineral deposits or learn about past movement of tectonic plates. Geophysicists also study Earth’s heat flow, magnetic field changes over time, and how the crust bends or flexes (called lithospheric flexure). They use different tools and techniques, like electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). These are used in looking for natural resources, studying buried ruins in archaeology, or checking for pollution underground. In oil and gas exploration, a method called reflection seismology helps create pictures of underground rock layers to find places where oil or gas may be trapped. Geophysics is not just for Earth, it also helps scientists study other planets. For example, NASA’s InSight mission to Mars placed seismometers on the planet to find marsquakes and learn about the Martian interior.

Geochemistry is the study of the chemicals and elements that make up the Earth and how they move and change over time. Geochemists look at how elements like carbon, oxygen, iron, and others are found in rocks, water, air, and living things. They also study how these elements move through different parts of the Earth, such as from the crust to the atmosphere or from soil into plants. One important part of this field is isotope geochemistry, which uses different forms of elements (called isotopes) to trace where things like groundwater or carbon come from. Another area is trace element analysis, which helps find valuable ore deposits like gold or copper. Radiogenic isotopes, isotopes that break down over time, are used in radiometric dating to figure out how old rocks and fossils are. Geochemists also study how elements move between solid rocks and melted magma, which helps them understand how volcanoes form and what the mantle (the layer below Earth’s crust) is made of. This information is important not just for science, but also for protecting the environment. For example, geochemists test soils for toxic metals or check for problems like acid mine drainage, which happens when mining releases harmful chemicals into nearby water. A related field called biogeochemistry looks at how living things and Earth’s systems work together. For example, it studies how bacteria help form minerals or how nutrients move through ecosystems. Geochemical fingerprints, unique chemical patterns, can be used to find out where sediments came from or to learn what past environments were like.

Geology: Study of the Solid Earth
Structure of the Earth
thumb|307x307px|Geological cross section of Earth, showing the different layers of the interior.
The Earth is made up of different layers, and learning about these layers is very important in geology, the science that studies the Earth. These layers affect how the surface of our planet changes and how it has developed over time. There are three main layers inside the Earth: the crust, the mantle, and the core. Each layer is different in what it is made of, how hot it is, and whether it is solid or liquid. The crust is the thin, solid outer layer of the Earth, and it is the part we live on. There are two kinds of crust. The continental crust is found under land. It is thicker (up to 70 kilometers) and made mostly of a rock called granite, which is not very dense. The oceanic crust is found under the oceans. It is thinner (about 5 to 10 kilometers) and made mostly of basalt, which is heavier and denser than granite. Underneath the crust is the mantle, which reaches about 2,900 kilometers deep. It is made mostly of a rock called peridotite. Although the mantle is solid, it can slowly flow like thick syrup because it is very hot. This slow movement, called convection, is caused by heat from inside the Earth and helps move the outer layers of the Earth.

The lithosphere is made up of the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle. It is hard and broken into large pieces called tectonic plates. These plates float on top of the asthenosphere, a softer and slightly melted part of the upper mantle. The asthenosphere can flow slowly, which allows the tectonic plates above it to move. At the center of the Earth is the core, which has two parts. The outer core is liquid and made mostly of iron and nickel. As it moves, it creates Earth's magnetic field through a process called the dynamo effect. The inner core is solid and also made mostly of iron and nickel. It stays solid because the pressure at the center of the Earth is extremely high. The way the Earth is built on the inside helps explain the theory of plate tectonics. This theory says that the plates of the lithosphere move over time, and this movement shapes the Earth’s surface. For example, at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, new ocean floor is made as plates move apart. At the San Andreas Fault in California, two plates slide past each other, which causes earthquakes.

Rocks and minerals
right|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Grand Canyon, a cut through layers of sedimentary rocks.]]
Geologists, who are scientists that study the Earth, group all Earth materials into two main categories: rocks and minerals. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals, and they can change from one type to another over time through a process called the rock cycle. There are three main types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks form when melted rock, known as magma (if it is underground) or lava (if it's on the surface), cools and hardens. If the magma cools slowly underground, it forms rocks like granite, which have large, visible crystals. These are called intrusive igneous rocks. If the lava cools quickly at the surface, it forms rocks like basalt, which have small or no visible crystals. These are called extrusive igneous rocks. Over time, rocks on the Earth’s surface are broken down into small pieces by wind, water, and other natural forces. This process is called weathering. The small pieces, called sediments, can build up in layers. As more layers pile on top, the weight presses them together. Over time, these layers stick together to form sedimentary rocks like limestone or sandstone. These rocks often contain fossils and can give clues about what the Earth was like in the past. When rocks are buried deep underground, they are exposed to a lot of heat and pressure. This can change the rocks into a new type called metamorphic rocks. This transformation does not melt the rock, but it changes its structure and mineral makeup. Examples of metamorphic rocks include schist and marble.

Minerals are the tiny building blocks that make up rocks. A mineral is a natural, solid substance with a special crystal shape and a chemical formula. Minerals have different properties that help scientists identify them. These include hardness (how easily it can be scratched), cleavage (how it breaks), luster (how shiny it is), density (how heavy it feels), and crystal structure (the shape of the crystals it forms). For example, the mineral quartz is quite hard and has a Mohs hardness of 7. It breaks in a curved way called conchoidal fracture. Another mineral, calcite, is softer and reacts by fizzing when it touches weak acid because it contains carbonate. Minerals are sorted into groups based on the main elements they contain. Some examples are silicates (like feldspar and mica), carbonates (like calcite), oxides (like hematite), and sulfides (like pyrite). Knowing about minerals is important in many jobs, like finding and using natural resources (mining), studying rocks (petrology), and protecting the Earth (environmental geology).

Geological processes
thumb|upright=1.5|[[Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain]]
Geological processes are natural actions that change the Earth's surface. These processes are important for understanding how our planet has changed in the past and how it continues to change today. They include events like volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, mountain formation, and the breaking down and movement of rocks and soil. Volcanism happens when magma (hot, melted rock from inside the Earth) comes to the surface. When it reaches the surface, it is called lava, and it may also explode as ash and other materials called pyroclastics. Volcanoes often form along the edges of tectonic plates or above hot spots deep in the Earth. There are different types of volcanoes. For example, stratovolcanoes like Mount Fuji are tall and steep because their magma is thick and sticky, leading to explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes like Mauna Loa have gentle, broad slopes because their magma is thinner and flows more easily, causing less violent eruptions.

Earthquakes happen when stress builds up along faults (cracks in the Earth's crust) and is suddenly released, causing the ground to shake. Scientists who study earthquakes are called seismologists, and they use tools called seismographs to measure how strong the shaking is and where it starts. The point where the earthquake begins is called the epicenter, and the strength is measured using the Moment Magnitude Scale. Some of the most earthquake-prone areas are subduction zones, where one tectonic plate slides underneath another. A well-known example is the Ring of Fire, which circles much of the Pacific Ocean. These areas often have both earthquakes and volcanoes.

Other important geological processes include weathering, erosion, and deposition. Weathering is the breaking down of rocks. It can happen physically, like when water freezes in cracks and breaks the rock apart (called frost wedging), or chemically, like when acid rain dissolves certain rocks like limestone. Once rocks are broken down, the pieces can be moved by wind, water, or ice in a process called erosion. These materials are eventually dropped off in new places in a process called deposition, where they may build up into layers over time. Mountains are created through a process called orogeny, which happens when tectonic plates collide. When one plate pushes against another, the land can be pushed upward to form mountains. The Andes Mountains formed when an ocean plate was pushed under a continent (a process called subduction), while the Alps formed from two continental plates crashing into each other. Mountain building involves things like uplift (land rising), folding (bending of rock layers), and faulting (breaking and movement along faults). These events often bring heat and pressure, which can change rocks into metamorphic rocks and lead to magma forming underground.

Geologic time
upright=3|thumb|300px|Earth's history with time-spans of the [[geologic time scale|eons to scale. Ma means "million years ago".]]
Geologists study geologic time to understand the history of the Earth, which is about 4.54 billion years old. This helps them figure out when certain events happened and how the Earth’s surface and life forms have changed over time. Because Earth’s history is so long, scientists divide it into different parts to make it easier to study and understand. To tell the order of events, geologists use something called relative dating. This does not give the exact age of a rock or fossil, but it tells which ones are older or younger. One rule is superposition, which means that in a stack of rock layers, the younger layers are on top, and the older layers are on the bottom. Another rule is cross-cutting relationships, which means that if a fault or igneous rock cuts through other rocks, it is younger than the rocks it cuts through.

To find out the actual age of rocks, scientists use radiometric dating. This method uses the natural breakdown of radioactive elements into other elements over time. For example, uranium-238 slowly changes into lead-206, and potassium-40 changes into argon-40. Because this decay happens at a constant rate, scientists can measure how much of each element is present and calculate the rock's age. Using these methods, the oldest minerals ever found on Earth, tiny crystals called zircons in Australia, have been dated to about 4.4 billion years old. To organize Earth’s history, scientists created the Geologic Time Scale. It breaks time into eons, eras, periods, and epochs. These time divisions are based on major changes in Earth’s systems or in the life forms living at the time. For example, the boundary between the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic eras, about 252 million years ago, marks the Permian–Triassic mass extinction. This was the largest extinction in Earth’s history and wiped out over 90% of marine species. Another famous event is the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, about 66 million years ago, likely caused by an asteroid. This event brought the age of dinosaurs to an end.

Oceanography: Study of Earth’s Oceans
thumb|[[Pacific Ocean of Earth seen from space in 1969]]
Oceanography is the science that studies Earth’s oceans. Since oceans cover more than 70% of Earth’s surface, they are a huge part of how our planet works. Oceans affect climate, help control weather, support a wide variety of living things, and shape parts of the Earth’s surface. Oceanography helps scientists understand not just the ocean itself, but also how it connects to things like the carbon cycle, global warming, and even the movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates.

Oceanography is made up of different branches, each studying a special part of the ocean. Physical oceanography looks at how water moves, like currents, waves, and how oceans and the atmosphere interact. Marine geology studies the ocean floor, including underwater mountains, volcanoes, and trenches. Chemical oceanography focuses on what the ocean is made of, like salt, gases, and nutrients. Biological oceanography studies ocean life, from tiny plankton to whales, and how these living things survive in different parts of the ocean.

Physical oceanography
thumb|upright=3|Ocean surface currents
Physical oceanography is the branch of ocean science that studies how ocean water moves and what its physical properties are, like temperature and density. One important part of this is understanding ocean currents. There are two main types of currents: surface currents and deep currents. Surface currents are mostly driven by winds and the Coriolis effect, which is caused by Earth’s rotation. Famous surface currents include the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean and the Kuroshio Current in the Pacific Ocean. These currents move warm water from the equator toward the poles, helping to warm places like Europe by bringing heat from tropical regions. Deep ocean currents, on the other hand, are powered by differences in water density. These differences happen because of changes in temperature and salinity (how salty the water is). This system of deep-water movement is called thermohaline circulation. It is also known as the global conveyor belt because it slowly moves water all around the world. These deep currents bring cold, nutrient-rich water from the poles into the deeper parts of the ocean, which helps store carbon and support the nutrient cycle that feeds marine life.

Ocean waves are mostly formed by the wind blowing across the surface of the water. The size and strength of a wave depend on how fast and long the wind blows, and how much open water (called the fetch) it travels across. Waves crash onto beaches, shape coastlines, and can even carry energy across entire oceans. Tides are another important ocean movement. They are the regular rise and fall of sea levels, mostly caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun. When the Moon and Sun line up, we get spring tides, which are especially high and low. When they are at right angles, we get neap tides, which are more moderate. Tides affect sea life and the way people use coastlines. There are also internal waves, which happen under the surface of the ocean where different layers of water meet. These waves cannot be seen from above, but they are very important because they help mix ocean layers and move nutrients around. Another key process is upwelling. This happens when deep, cold water rises up to the surface, bringing nutrients with it. These areas, like those near Peru and California, are some of the most productive places in the ocean. They support large numbers of fish and other marine animals because there is so much food available.

Marine geology
thumb|upright=1.7| 
Marine geology is the study of the ocean floor, what it is made of, how it changes, and how it has developed over time. The bottom of the ocean, also called the seafloor, has many interesting features. These include continental margins (edges of continents underwater), abyssal plains (flat, deep ocean areas), mid-ocean ridges (underwater mountain chains), ocean trenches (deep valleys), and submarine volcanoes (volcanoes under the sea). At mid-ocean ridges, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, two tectonic plates move away from each other. When they do, magma from below the Earth's surface rises up and hardens to form new oceanic crust. This process is called seafloor spreading. It is one of the main ways scientists know that plate tectonics, the idea that Earth’s outer shell is made of moving plates, is true. Another interesting discovery is the pattern of magnetic stripes on either side of these ridges. These stripes show that Earth's magnetic field has reversed many times in the past. The magnetic pattern is the same on both sides of the ridge, which means the seafloor has been spreading evenly for millions of years.

Submarine volcanoes form in several places. They can be found in volcanic arcs (chains of volcanoes near trenches) or over hotspots, like the one that created the Hawaiian Islands. As lava from these volcanoes piles up, it can build underwater mountains or even islands that rise above the sea. On the other hand, oceanic trenches are the deepest parts of the ocean. The Mariana Trench is the deepest of them all. Trenches form where one tectonic plate goes under another in a process called subduction. These zones are very active. They are often the site of powerful earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and even tsunamis. Scientists also study marine sediments, tiny particles that settle on the seafloor over time. These layers help us understand the Earth's past climate, ocean life, and tectonic activity. For example, shells of tiny sea creatures called foraminifera can be found in deep-sea cores. The chemical makeup of their shells helps scientists understand what the ocean temperatures were like and whether there was ice thousands or even millions of years ago.

Chemical oceanography
thumb|upright=1.5|Diagram of the ocean carbon cycle
Chemical oceanography is the study of what seawater is made of and how chemicals move and change in the ocean. One important thing chemical oceanographers look at is salinity, which means how much salt is dissolved in ocean water. On average, seawater has about 35 parts of salt for every 1,000 parts of water, but this can change depending on the location. For example, salinity is higher in places where lots of water evaporates, like in hot, dry areas, and lower where there is lots of rainfall or fresh water from rivers. The two most common parts, or ions, in seawater are sodium (Na⁺) and chloride (Cl⁻), which together make table salt. But seawater also contains other important elements like magnesium, calcium, sulfate, and bicarbonate. There are also tiny amounts of trace metals, like iron and zinc, which are very important for marine life even though there is not much of them.

The ocean and the atmosphere are constantly exchanging gases, which helps drive Earth’s carbon cycle and oxygen cycle. Oceans absorb about 25 to 30 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO₂) that humans release into the air. When the ocean takes in too much CO₂, it affects the carbonate buffering system, which keeps the pH (how acidic or basic) of seawater balanced. Too much CO₂ makes the ocean more acidic, a problem known as ocean acidification. This makes it harder for sea creatures like corals, shellfish, and mollusks to build their calcium carbonate shells. Oceans are also the largest source of dissolved oxygen, which comes from two main sources. It comes from the air into the water. It is also made by phytoplankton, tiny ocean plants that do photosynthesis. Just like land plants, they produce oxygen as they turn sunlight into energy. Another key part of chemical oceanography is studying how nutrients move through the ocean. Important nutrients include nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica. These are used by marine organisms to grow and survive. Nutrients are taken up by living things, released when organisms decompose, and moved around by the mixing of ocean water. In places called upwelling zones, deep water full of nutrients rises to the surface, helping tiny organisms like phytoplankton grow. This leads to primary production, which supports the entire ocean food chain.

Biological oceanography
thumb|upright=3|left|Some ocean animals (not drawn to scale) 
Biological oceanography is the study of marine life, the animals, plants, and tiny organisms that live in the ocean. It also studies how they interact with each other and with their environment. The ocean is divided into different layers or zones, from the sunlit surface to the dark, deep trenches. Each zone has its own types of life, adapted to different levels of light, pressure, and temperature. At the very bottom of the ocean food web are tiny organisms called phytoplankton. These are microscopic algae, like diatoms and dinoflagellates, that use sunlight to make their own food through photosynthesis, just like land plants. In fact, phytoplankton produce about half of the oxygen on Earth. They are eaten by zooplankton, which are small animals like copepods and krill, and these are then eaten by larger animals, such as fish and whales.

One of the most famous marine ecosystems is the coral reef. Found in shallow, warm tropical waters, coral reefs are full of life and support more than 25% of all ocean species, even though they cover less than 1% of the ocean floor. Corals themselves are tiny animals that live in groups and build hard skeletons. They have a special partnership with algae called zooxanthellae, which live inside their tissues and help provide them with food. But if the water gets too warm, this relationship can break down, causing the corals to lose their color, a problem called coral bleaching.

Marine life includes a wide variety of organisms. Nektonic animals, like fish, squid, and whales, can swim freely through the water. Benthic animals, such as crabs, sea stars, and worms, live on or near the ocean floor. In the deep ocean, where there is no sunlight, some animals live near hydrothermal vents or cold seeps. These areas are powered not by sunlight, but by chemosynthesis, where bacteria use chemicals like hydrogen sulfide or methane to make food. Creatures like giant tube worms, vent crabs, and the fuzzy-looking Yeti crab live in these dark, extreme environments. Biological oceanography is important because it helps us learn how to protect marine animals, manage fisheries, and understand how ocean life is affected by things like pollution, climate change, and overfishing. It helps scientists find ways to keep ocean ecosystems healthy and balanced for the future.

Meteorology: Study of the Atmosphere
thumb|Satellite image of [[Hurricane Hugo with a polar low seen at the top of the image]]
Meteorology is the science that studies the atmosphere, the thin layer of gases that surrounds the Earth. Even though the atmosphere is thin, it is very important for life. It helps keep Earth’s temperature just right, moves water around the planet through rain and snow, and protects us from the Sun’s harmful rays. Meteorologists are scientists who study the atmosphere to understand weather and climate. They look at things like temperature, air pressure, humidity (how much moisture is in the air), and wind. To do this, they use special tools such as weather balloons that rise high into the sky, satellites that watch the Earth from space, and radar systems that track rain and storms. They also use computer models to predict how weather patterns might change in the future.

Meteorology helps us in many ways. It helps predict the weather so people can prepare for storms, heatwaves, or cold fronts. It is also important for airplane safety, planning farming activities, and creating climate models to understand long-term changes in Earth’s climate. This science combines ideas from physics, chemistry, and the study of fluids to explain how the atmosphere works. By learning how energy and moisture move through the atmosphere, meteorologists can better understand both daily weather and big climate changes over time. This knowledge is important for helping communities prepare for natural disasters, make smart environmental decisions, and stay safe during extreme weather events.

Composition and structure
thumb|upright=1.3|[[Atmosphere of Earth when seen from space on board the ISS at an altitude of (the Moon is visible as a crescent in the far background).]]
The atmosphere is made up of different gases that are very important for life on Earth and for creating weather. Most of the atmosphere is nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The last 1% includes gases like argon, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, and a few others. Even though these other gases are only present in small amounts, they have big effects. For example, carbon dioxide and methane trap heat, helping to warm the Earth, while ozone helps block harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun. Water vapor, which can range from 0 to 4% of the atmosphere, is also very important because it forms clouds, causes rain, and plays a big role in the greenhouse effect. The atmosphere has five main layers, which are separated by how the temperature changes as you go higher up. The lowest layer is the troposphere. It goes from the ground up to about 8 to 15 kilometers, depending on where you are and what season it is. This is where all weather happens, and it contains about 75% of the atmosphere’s total mass. As you go higher in the troposphere, the air gets colder. The top of this layer is called the tropopause, where the temperature stops dropping.

Above that is the stratosphere, where the ozone layer is found. This layer warms up as you go higher because ozone absorbs UV radiation from the Sun. Next is the mesosphere, which is the coldest layer. In this layer, the temperature drops again with altitude, and it is where meteors usually burn up when they enter Earth’s atmosphere. Then comes the thermosphere, where temperatures go way up because of solar activity. This layer contains the ionosphere, which is important because it reflects radio waves, making long-distance radio communication possible. The last layer is the exosphere, which is the outermost layer and slowly fades into outer space. In this layer, some gases can even escape into space. Even very tiny amounts of certain chemicals, like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), can have huge effects. In the past, CFCs caused major damage to the ozone layer, which made it easier for harmful UV rays to reach Earth. Scientists and governments worked together to stop using these chemicals, helping to protect the ozone and the environment.

Weather
thumb|upright=1.34|Thunderstorm near Port-la-Nouvelle, [[France]]
Weather happens because of the way energy moves through the atmosphere, especially through heat and water. One of the most important weather processes is cloud formation. This happens when warm, moist air rises and cools down. As it cools to its dew point, the water vapor in the air condenses (turns into tiny droplets) around tiny particles in the air, like dust or sea salt. These tiny droplets form clouds. Clouds come in different shapes and heights. The main types are cirrus (thin and wispy, high up), cumulus (fluffy and white), and stratus (flat and gray). Sometimes clouds are a mix of types. Precipitation, like rain, snow, or hail, happens when the droplets or ice crystals in a cloud get big and heavy enough to fall to the ground. There are different ways this happens depending on the temperature inside the cloud. For example, in cold clouds, ice crystals grow as water vapor sticks to them (called the Bergeron process). In warm clouds, droplets collide and join together until they fall (called collision-coalescence).

Large bodies of air called air masses can also affect the weather. These air masses have the same temperature and humidity throughout and form over large areas like oceans or continents. When two air masses meet, they form a front, which is the boundary between them. Fronts are where we get most of our active weather. A cold front pushes under warm air and can cause thunderstorms. A warm front brings lighter rain and gentle warming. Occluded fronts and stationary fronts can lead to long-lasting or complicated weather patterns with lots of rain or clouds.

Some weather systems are very powerful. One type is called an extratropical cyclone, which forms along fronts in mid-latitudes. These storms are shaped by the jet stream (fast-moving air high in the sky) and changes in air temperature. Another type is a thunderstorm, which starts when warm, moist air rises and releases energy as it cools. Some thunderstorms become supercells, which are strong enough to produce hail, strong winds, and even tornadoes. A tornado is a spinning column of air that reaches from a thunderstorm down to the ground. Tornadoes are measured using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale, from EF0 (weakest) to EF5 (most destructive). Another major type of storm is a tropical cyclone, also called a hurricane or typhoon depending on where it forms. These storms get their energy from warm ocean water and have a calm center called the eye, surrounded by spiral bands of rain and wind. The strength of a hurricane is measured using the Saffir–Simpson Scale, which ranks them by their wind speed. Their path depends on things like ocean temperatures, the Coriolis effect (caused by Earth’s rotation), and winds high in the atmosphere.

Climate science
alt=Map of world dividing climate zones, largely influenced by latitude. The zones, going from the equator upward (and downward) are Tropical, Dry, Moderate, Continental and Polar. There are subzones within these zones.|thumb|Worldwide [[Köppen climate classifications]]
Climate science is the study of long-term weather patterns and what causes them. Unlike weather, which can change daily, climate looks at how temperature and rainfall behave over many years. Scientists use systems like the Köppen classification to group different parts of the world into climate zones. These include tropical, dry (arid), temperate, continental, and polar climates. Each zone has its own average temperatures and types of precipitation, like rain or snow. Climate zones are shaped by how air moves around the Earth. These air movements are called global circulation patterns, and they are driven by the Sun's heat and the Earth's spinning motion. There are three main circulation cells in each hemisphere: the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells. These help move warm air from the equator toward the poles. Winds like the trade winds, westerlies, and polar easterlies form because of these air movements and affect weather in different regions. Jet streams, which are strong winds high in the sky, also influence how storms move.

Scientists use computer models, called Global Circulation Models (GCMs), to predict how the climate might change in the future. These models include information about the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice. They also use satellite data, historical records, and data about how the Earth reacts to sunlight and greenhouse gases. These tools help scientists understand how human actions and natural changes affect the climate. One of the biggest topics in climate science is climate change caused by human activity. Since the Industrial Revolution, people have burned more fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas), cut down forests, and used farming methods that release gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, a process called the greenhouse effect, which is causing global warming.

The Earth's average temperature has gone up by more than 1.1°C since the late 1800s. This warming has led to melting ice, rising sea levels, and stronger storms and heatwaves. Scientists also worry about feedback loops, changes that make warming even worse. For example, when ice melts, it reflects less sunlight, causing the Earth to heat up faster (this is called the ice–albedo feedback). Also, frozen ground (permafrost) can release methane as it thaws, adding more greenhouse gases to the air. Climate change affects different places in different ways. In Africa, droughts may get worse. In the Atlantic Ocean, hurricanes may become stronger. Changing rainfall patterns may harm farming and water supplies. Scientists study past climates, using ice cores, tree rings, and ocean sediments to learn how Earth’s climate has changed before. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) brings together scientists from all over the world to study climate change and give advice to governments. Understanding how Earth’s atmosphere works helps us find solutions, such as cutting greenhouse gas emissions, planting more trees to absorb carbon, or using new technologies to cool the planet.

Astronomy: Earth in Space
thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Paranal Observatory of European Southern Observatory shooting a laser guide star to the Galactic Center]]
Astronomy, when connected to Earth science, helps us understand how Earth fits into the larger universe. It looks at how objects in space, like the Sun, the Moon, and the planets, affect life on Earth. These celestial events play a big role in shaping things like our climate, seasons, tides, and even some geological processes such as how the Earth’s crust behaves over time. For example, Earth’s orbit around the Sun and its tilted axis are what cause the seasons. The Moon’s gravity pulls on Earth’s oceans and creates tides, which rise and fall regularly. Even biological rhythms, like how animals migrate or plants grow, are often linked to daylight cycles caused by Earth’s rotation. Events like solar flares and geomagnetic storms from the Sun can also affect Earth’s magnetic field and even interfere with satellites and communication systems.

Over the centuries, people have watched the skies to learn more about these effects. Today, scientists use powerful tools like space telescopes, radio antennas, and satellites to observe the universe in much more detail. These instruments help track the movement of planets, predict eclipses, monitor solar activity, and study asteroids that might come close to Earth.

The Earth-Sun-Moon System
300px|thumb|Total solar eclipse
The tilt of Earth’s axis, which is about 23.5 degrees, and its oval-shaped (elliptical) orbit around the Sun are what cause the seasons. When Earth tilts toward the Sun, that part of the world gets more sunlight and experiences summer. When it tilts away, it is winter. A solstice happens when the tilt is most extreme. Around June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere brings the longest day of the year. Around December 21, the winter solstice brings the shortest. The equinoxes, which happen around March 21 and September 23, are times when day and night are nearly equal all over the world. That’s because the Sun is shining directly on the equator.

The Moon’s phases, like the new moon, half moon, and full moon, happen because of how the Moon orbits Earth and how sunlight shines on it from different angles. A new moon occurs when the Moon is between Earth and the Sun, so we cannot see the lit side. A full moon happens when Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, so we see the entire lit side. Sometimes, the Sun, Earth, and Moon line up perfectly, causing an eclipse. In a solar eclipse, the Moon blocks the Sun’s light and casts a shadow on Earth. In a lunar eclipse, Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon, making it look dark or red. Eclipses do not happen every month because the Moon’s orbit is tilted, and it only crosses Earth’s orbital path at certain times called eclipse seasons.

The Moon’s gravity also pulls on Earth’s oceans and causes tides. When the Sun and Moon line up, during new and full moons, they create spring tides, which have higher high tides and lower low tides. During quarter moons, the Sun and Moon are at right angles, and they create neap tides, which are not as strong. In some places, like the Bay of Fundy in Canada, the shape of the coastline can make tides even more extreme due to a special effect called tidal resonance.

Influence of the Sun
300px|alt=White glowing ball with black sunspots|thumb|The Sun
The Sun affects Earth in many important ways, not just by giving us light and heat, but also by sending out energy and particles. Most of the energy we get from the Sun comes as visible light, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and infrared (IR) energy. This energy powers Earth’s climate and helps plants perform photosynthesis, which is how they make food. The amount of sunlight, also called insolation, depends on how Earth is tilted and how far it is from the Sun. Even small changes in the Sun’s energy output, such as those during the 11-year sunspot cycle, can slightly affect Earth’s weather and climate.

Besides light, the Sun also sends out a steady flow of tiny charged particles called the solar wind. These particles, mostly protons and electrons, travel very fast through space and reach Earth all the time. Earth is protected by a powerful magnetic field, called the magnetosphere, which is created by movement in Earth’s liquid outer core. This magnetic shield stops most of the solar wind. But during strong solar events like solar storms or coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the flow of particles becomes much stronger and can compress the magnetosphere. When this happens, it can disturb satellites, GPS signals, and even electrical power grids on Earth.

When the solar wind hits the upper part of Earth’s atmosphere near the North and South Poles, it creates beautiful displays called auroras. In the Northern Hemisphere, it's called the aurora borealis (Northern Lights), and in the Southern Hemisphere, it is called the aurora australis (Southern Lights). These colorful lights appear when solar particles excite atoms like oxygen and nitrogen in the thermosphere, causing them to glow. Different gases and heights produce different colors: green light comes from oxygen around 100 kilometers high, red from oxygen even higher up, and blue or purple from nitrogen. Auroras are most visible during times of high solar activity and are often seen in places like Scandinavia, Alaska, and Antarctica.

Earth’s Place in the Universe
300px|thumb|Each dot represents a [[galaxy]]
Earth travels around the Sun in a slightly oval-shaped path called an elliptical orbit. It takes about 365.25 days to complete one full trip around the Sun, which is why we have a leap day every four years to keep our calendar in sync. Earth also spins on its axis once every 23 hours and 56 minutes, which is called a sidereal day. However, because Earth is also moving around the Sun, our normal solar day, from one noon to the next, is exactly 24 hours. Earth’s orbit follows rules discovered by the scientist Johannes Kepler. According to Kepler’s laws, Earth moves faster in its orbit when it is closer to the Sun (called perihelion) and slower when it is farther away (called aphelion). Over thousands of years, the gravity from the Sun, Moon, and other planets can slightly change Earth’s orbit. These slow changes, called Milankovitch cycles, include shifts in Earth’s shape of orbit (eccentricity), its tilt (axial tilt), and the wobble of its axis (precession). These cycles are connected to long-term climate patterns like ice ages.

Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula, which was left over from exploded stars. Small pieces called planetesimals stuck together through accretion, slowly building up into planets. As Earth grew, its heavier materials sank to the center, forming a metal core, while lighter rocks rose to become the mantle and crust. A big event called the giant impact hypothesis suggests that a Mars-sized object named Theia hit Earth early on. The debris from this crash likely formed the Moon, and the impact also tilted Earth’s axis, giving us seasons. Earth is located in a special part of the solar system called the habitable zone, where temperatures allow liquid water, a key ingredient for life, to exist. Our planet moves through the Milky Way galaxy in a spiral region known as the Orion Arm, taking about 225 to 250 million years to orbit the galaxy’s center once.

The following disciplines are generally recognised as being within the geosciences:
 Geology describes the rocky parts of the Earth's crust (or lithosphere) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are mineralogy and petrology, geochemistry, geomorphology, paleontology, Mineralogy, petrophysics, stratigraphy, structural geology, engineering geology and sedimentology.
 Geophysics and Geodesy investigate the shape of the Earth, its reaction to forces and its magnetic and gravity fields. Geophysicists explore the Earth's core and mantle as well as the tectonic and seismic activity of the lithosphere.
 Soil science covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or pedosphere).
 Oceanography and hydrology (includes limnology) describe the marine and freshwater domains of the watery parts of the Earth (or hydrosphere). Includes Marine biology.
 Glaciology covers the icy parts of the Earth (or cryosphere).
 Atmospheric sciences cover the gaseous parts of the Earth (or atmosphere) between the surface and the exosphere (about 1000&nbsp;km). Major subdisciplines are meteorology, climatology, atmospheric chemistry and physics.
 Astronomy includes the study of distant stars and galaxies to the examination of the 4.6 billion years old Earth from an astronomical point of view. It is also closely related with the study of the solar system and its planets, a subdiscipline called planetology. A more distant relative of astronomy is physical cosmology, which aims to study the Universe as a whole.
 Closely related to the earth sciences are physical geography and biology.

Earth’s outer layer, called the crust, is made of big pieces called tectonic plates that slowly move around. When these plates push against each other, they can create mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. You can think of it like giant puzzle pieces slowly sliding and bumping into each other. Deep inside Earth, there is a liquid outer core. This spinning liquid creates a magnetic field around the planet, called a magnetosphere. The magnetosphere works like a protective shield, keeping most of the dangerous solar winds and cosmic radiation from reaching the surface, which helps life survive. Similar words exist in many Germanic languages, and scientists think they all come from an even older word called Proto-Germanic erþō. In the past, the word ' was used to mean many things, just like the Latin word ' or the Greek word gē. It could mean the ground, the soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the planet (including the seas), or even the planet as a whole. Basically, it was a word for almost anything we associate with the world we live on. Long ago, like in Roman and Greek stories, people sometimes imagined Earth as a goddess. In Norse mythology, for example, there was Jörð, a giantess who represented the Earth and was said to be the mother of Thor, the god of thunder.

In the past, the word “earth” was usually written with a lowercase “e.” During the Early Middle English period, people started using the phrase “the earth” to mean the whole planet, or the globe. Later, in the Early Modern English period, people began capitalizing nouns more often, so you also started seeing “the Earth”, especially when talking about it along with the Sun, Moon, or other planets. Today, people sometimes just write “Earth” with a capital letter, like the names of other planets, but the lowercase form “earth” is still very common.

The planet Earth has had many names throughout history. Terra is one of these names. Scientists sometimes use it in writing, and science fiction writers use it to make it clear they are talking about our planet and not another one. In poetry, the name Tellus has been used to imagine Earth as a person, like giving the planet human qualities. Some languages, called Romance languages because they come from Latin, use Terra or similar words as the name for Earth. For example, Italian and Portuguese still call it Terra. In Spanish, it became Tierra, and in French, it became Terre. You can think of it like how a single family recipe can change a little in different countries. The Greek name for Earth was Gaia, or sometimes spelled Gaea in English. This name is used less often, but it became more popular with the Gaia hypothesis, which is a scientific idea that Earth works like a living system. With this, people usually say it as GYE-uh instead of the older English pronunciation GAY-uh.

There are many words that come from the names of the planet Earth. For example, the word earthly comes directly from the word Earth. People use it to describe things that belong to or come from our planet. Other words come from the Latin name Terra. From this, we get terran, terrestrial, and terrene. These words all mean “related to Earth” or “living on Earth.” For example, scientists might call animals that live on land “terrestrial animals,” like lions, elephants, and humans. Some words come from the Latin name Tellus, like tellurian and telluric. These words also mean “related to Earth.”

Natural history

Formation

thumb|upright=1.3|A depiction of the early [[Solar System's protoplanetary disk from which Earth and other Solar System bodies were formed]]
The oldest solid stuff in the Solar System is made of tiny pieces called CAIs, which stands for calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions. These pieces are found in some very old meteorites. Scientists have measured them and found that they are about 4.568 billion years old. These were the very first solid materials that formed from a big cloud of gas and dust in space, called the solar nebula, which later made the Sun and planets. Earth formed a little later, around 4.54 billion years ago.

A long time ago, there was a huge cloud of gas and dust in space called a molecular cloud. Gravity pulled part of this cloud together, which made it shrink, spin, and flatten into a disk around the forming Sun. This disk is called the solar nebula. It had gas, ice, dust, and even radioactive materials like uranium and thorium, which gave off heat as they broke down. Tiny dust particles in the disk bumped into each other and stuck together. Over time, these clumps grew into larger rocks called planetesimals, which were the building blocks of planets. Earth grew by slowly collecting these pieces, a process called accretion, which took about 70 to 100 million years. As smaller bodies crashed into the growing Earth, they created a lot of heat, melting parts of the planet. When Earth first formed, it was very hot and mostly molten, like a giant ball of lava. Over time, it cooled and separated into layers. The heaviest metals sank to make the core, lighter rocks formed the mantle, and the outer layer became a basic crust.

Scientists are still studying how the Moon formed. They think it is about 4.5 billion years old, but it might be a little younger depending on how it is measured. The most accepted idea is called the Giant Impact Hypothesis. According to this idea, a planet-sized object called Theia, about one-tenth the size of Earth, collided with early Earth. The collision was not straight-on but more like a glancing blow. Pieces of Theia and Earth’s outer layer broke off, forming a ring of debris around Earth. This debris later came together to make the Moon. The collision also changed Earth’s spin and tilted its axis.

After the Moon formed, the inner Solar System went through a time called the Late Heavy Bombardment, about 4.0 to 3.8 billion years ago. During this time, many asteroids and comets crashed into the Moon and Earth, making large craters on the Moon, like Imbrium, Serenitatis, and Crisium. Some impacts may have melted parts of the Moon’s crust and caused volcanic activity. On Earth, these impacts affected the surface and atmosphere and might have helped life start by bringing water and organic molecules, or by creating hot underwater areas called hydrothermal vents, which can support life. Scientists think the movements of giant planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, may have disturbed the orbits of asteroids and comets, sending them toward the inner planets and causing this heavy bombardment.

After formation

thumb|upright=1.5|Pale orange dot, an impression of [[Early Earth, featuring its tinted orange methane-rich early atmosphere]]
Most of Earth’s air and water came from volcanoes. When volcanoes erupted, they released gases trapped inside the planet. This process is called outgassing. These gases included water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and small amounts of other gases. The water vapor cooled down and formed the first oceans. Some water also came from space, brought by asteroids, icy protoplanets, and comets. These space objects added more water from different parts of the Solar System. Scientists think there might have been enough water to fill today’s oceans very soon after Earth formed, so our planet was basically “wet” from the start.

Back then, the young Sun was only about 70% as bright as it is now. Normally, this would have made Earth very cold. But greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane trapped heat, keeping the oceans from freezing. This made Earth warm enough for liquid water, which is important for life. Around 3.5 billion years ago, Earth also developed a magnetic field, created by the movement of molten iron in the core. This magnetic field acted like a shield, protecting the atmosphere from being blown away by the solar wind, which helped Earth keep its water and stay stable for life.

As Earth cooled, the molten outer layer hardened to form the first crust, mostly made of mafic rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium but low in silica. Later, the first pieces of continental crust appeared. These rocks were more felsic, meaning they had more silica, aluminum, potassium, and sodium. Scientists think these formed when parts of the mafic crust melted at very high temperatures, helped by early tectonic activity or mantle plumes.

The oldest continental crust is known from tiny minerals called zircons, some of which date back to 4.4 billion years ago, only about 140 million years after Earth formed. Scientists are still figuring out how these small pieces of crust grew into the large continents we have today. Some think growth was slow and steady over billions of years. Others think most continents formed quickly during the Archean eon. Both ideas could be true because the crust was constantly recycled, subducted, eroded, and melted, changing early continents over time.

New continental crust still forms today thanks to plate tectonics, which is the movement of large pieces of Earth’s crust. Heat from inside Earth causes mantle convection, where hot rock slowly rises and sinks. This drives processes like subduction (one plate sliding under another) and volcanoes. Over millions of years, these movements cause continents to come together into supercontinents and then break apart. For example:
 Rodinia started breaking apart ~750 million years ago
 Pannotia formed ~600–540 million years ago
 Pangaea began breaking ~180 million years ago

The movement and collision of continents affect Earth’s surface, climate, oceans, and life. When continents collide, they form mountains. When they pull apart, they create valleys and basins where sediments collect. These changes have influenced the evolution of plants, animals, and humans over millions of years.

Earth’s climate has gone through many ice ages, when large parts of the planet were covered in ice. These started around 40 million years ago and became very strong during the Pleistocene epoch (~3 million years ago). Areas far from the equator went through repeated cycles of glaciation (ice sheets growing) and thawing (ice melting). These cycles happen because of small changes in Earth’s orbit and tilt, called Milankovitch cycles, which change how sunlight hits Earth roughly every 21,000, 41,000, and 100,000 years. The most recent ice age, called the Last Glacial Period, covered large parts of continents with thick ice sheets. It ended about 11,700 years ago, marking the start of the Holocene epoch. Since then, Earth’s climate has been relatively stable, which allowed humans to build civilizations and thrive.

Origin of life and evolution

thumb|upright=1.2|An artist's impression of the [[Archean eon, a time billions of years ago right after Earth formed. The picture shows stromatolites, early life forms that made oxygen. After the Late Heavy Bombardment, Earth's crust had cooled, continents and volcanoes had appeared, and the Moon was much closer (about half the distance it is today), making it look almost three times bigger and causing very strong tides.]]

Scientists think life on Earth began about 4 billion years ago. It likely started with simple chemical reactions that made the first molecules able to copy themselves. These molecules were probably short pieces of RNA, which is similar to DNA. RNA is important because it can both store instructions (like a recipe book) and speed up chemical reactions. The fact that these molecules could copy and change over time was the very beginning of evolution. Around 3.5 billion years ago, something very important appeared: the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). LUCA was not the very first life, but it was the ancestor of all living things we know today, from bacteria and archaea to plants and animals. LUCA already had the basic tools of life that every organism still uses. It could copy DNA, read it into RNA, and build proteins from those instructions. It also had ways to get energy, either from chemical reactions or from sunlight. In other words, LUCA was like the great-grandparent of all life on Earth, passing down the same core tools that living things still use billions of years later.

A huge change in Earth’s history happened when some bacteria learned how to do photosynthesis, the process of using sunlight to make energy. Plants do this today, but the first organisms to do it were tiny bacteria called cyanobacteria. When they made energy from sunlight, they released oxygen as waste. At first, Earth’s air had almost no oxygen. But over hundreds of millions of years, oxygen built up in the atmosphere. About 2.4 billion years ago, during the Great Oxidation Event, oxygen became much more common. Some of this oxygen turned into the ozone layer, a shield high above Earth that blocks dangerous UV rays from the Sun. Thanks to this protection, life could eventually move from the oceans onto land. Oxygen also changed the way life got energy. Before oxygen, organisms used less efficient methods that did not give them much power. But with oxygen, they could do aerobic respiration, which makes much more energy from food like glucose. This extra energy allowed larger and more complex life to evolve.

Another big step was when life went from simple cells to complex cells. This happened through a process called endosymbiosis, which means “living together inside.” Long ago, some small cells started living inside bigger ones. Instead of being eaten, the smaller cells became permanent helpers. Over time, they turned into organelles, special parts of complex cells. For example, mitochondria make energy, and chloroplasts (in plants) do photosynthesis. These new complex cells are called eukaryotic cells, and they have a nucleus (a control center). Eventually, they started living in groups. At first, they formed loose colonies, but later they became multicellular organisms, where cells had different jobs, like protecting, gathering food, or reproducing. This teamwork made life much more advanced. Meanwhile, the ozone layer kept protecting Earth, allowing living things to slowly spread from oceans to land.

Scientists have found fossils that prove life is very old. For example, tiny structures made by microorganisms have been found in rocks 3.45–3.7 billion years old. Even some rocks from 4.1 billion years ago show signs of life. These fossils include microbial mats (thin layers of bacteria), tiny cell-like shapes, and special carbon (graphite) that likely came from living things. Much later, between 1,000 and 539 million years ago, Earth may have gone through a frozen period called Snowball Earth, when ice covered nearly the whole planet, even near the equator. After this icy time came the Cambrian explosion about 535 million years ago. Life suddenly became much more diverse. Many major groups of animals we know today first appeared then, including animals with shells, backbones, and specialized body parts.

Over Earth’s history, there have been at least five major mass extinctions. A mass extinction is when a huge number of species die in a short time. Each one reshaped ecosystems and forced life to evolve in new ways. The most famous mass extinction happened about 66 million years ago when a giant asteroid hit near today’s Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. This caused massive climate changes and wiped out the dinosaurs that could not fly (non-avian dinosaurs) along with many other reptiles. But smaller animals, like mammals, birds, lizards, and insects, survived. Because of this, mammals had the chance to grow and spread, eventually becoming the dominant animals on Earth.

After the dinosaurs died out, mammals quickly evolved to fill many different roles. Some stayed small and fast, while others grew large. A few million years ago, one type of ape in Africa changed in an important way. It started walking on two legs. This freed up its hands to carry things and make tools. Tool use encouraged more complex communication and the growth of larger brains. This path eventually led to the first humans. Humans changed the world in powerful ways. They learned farming, tamed animals like dogs and cows, and built civilizations. These advances let humans shape the land, grow in numbers, and change entire ecosystems. Today, human activity is causing many plants and animals to go extinct much faster than normal. Cutting down forests, polluting air and water, hunting too much, and causing climate change are all big factors. Many scientists believe we may now be living through a new mass extinction, called the Holocene extinction, caused mostly by humans.

Future

thumb|upright=1.3|alt=A dark gray and red sphere representing the Earth lies against a black background to the right of an orange circular object representing the Sun|Artist's illustration of the scorched Earth after the [[Sun has entered the red giant phase, about 5–7&nbsp;billion years in the future]]

Earth’s future is closely tied to the Sun, because the Sun’s energy controls our climate, atmosphere, and even our orbit. As the Sun changes over time, Earth will change too. In the next 1.1 billion years, the Sun will shine about 10% brighter than today. That might not sound like much, but it will make Earth much hotter. In about 3.5 billion years, the Sun could be 40% brighter, making Earth almost impossible for life to survive. This happens because inside the Sun, hydrogen is fused into helium. As the core changes, the Sun slowly shines more strongly. Even small changes in sunlight can upset Earth’s climate system and make the planet hotter.

One of the first big problems will be the loss of carbon dioxide from the air. Plants need CO₂ for photosynthesis, which makes food and releases oxygen. But as Earth gets hotter, rock weathering (rain and heat breaking down rocks) will speed up. This process traps carbon in rocks instead of leaving it in the air. Today, CO₂ levels are over 400 ppm. In 100 to 900 million years, CO₂ levels may drop so low, below 10 parts per million (ppm), that even the toughest plants would not survive. Without plants, there will be no photosynthesis, so oxygen will slowly disappear. Without oxygen, animals, including humans cannot survive. This means Earth will eventually become uninhabitable for all oxygen-breathing life.

As the Sun keeps brightening, Earth will get even hotter. In about 1.5 billion years, the average temperature could reach 100 °C (212 °F), the boiling point of water. The oceans would start to boil away. As water evaporates, huge amounts of water vapor (a strong greenhouse gas) would fill the air. This would trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, where Earth heats up uncontrollably, just like Venus, which is now over 460 °C (860 °F). Scientists think this would happen in about 1.6 to 3 billion years. By then, all oceans would be gone, and Earth’s water would escape into space. Even if the Sun stayed stable, Earth would still slowly lose water. Some ocean water sinks into the mantle at tectonic plate edges. Normally, volcanoes return some water, but as Earth’s interior cools and volcanic activity slows, less water comes back. Over billions of years, Earth would still dry out.

In about 5 billion years, the Sun will run out of hydrogen in its core. Fusion will shift to outer layers, and the Sun will swell into a red giant, about 250 times wider than today. Its size could reach 1 astronomical unit (AU), which is Earth’s current distance from the Sun. Mercury and Venus will be swallowed. Earth’s fate is uncertain. The Sun will lose about 30% of its mass as strong stellar winds blow gas into space. With less mass, the Sun’s gravity will weaken, and Earth could drift outward to about 1.7 AU, possibly safe. But other forces, like tidal pulls and drag from the Sun’s outer gases, might slow Earth down. If that happens, Earth could spiral inward and be swallowed, burning up inside the Sun. After its red giant phase, the Sun will shed its outer layers, creating a glowing planetary nebula. Its core will shrink into a white dwarf, a small, dense star made mostly of carbon and oxygen. Whether Earth survives in a distant orbit or is destroyed inside the Sun is still a mystery. Earth’s average diameter is about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles), making it the fifth largest planet in the Solar System. Only the giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are bigger. Earth is the largest rocky planet, bigger than Mercury, Venus, and Mars. Being this big gives Earth enough gravity to hold onto a thick atmosphere, which helps life survive. Smaller planets, like Mars, lost much of their air over time because they don’t have enough gravity to keep it.

Because Earth spins once every 24 hours, it is not perfectly round. It bulges slightly at the equator and is a bit flattened at the poles. Scientists call this shape an oblate spheroid. The equator is about 43 kilometers (27 miles) wider than the distance from pole to pole. This happens because of centrifugal force, a pushing-out effect caused by spinning. Earth spins fastest at the equator, about 1,670 km/h (1,040 mph), while the poles do not spin at all. The equatorial radius (distance from the center to the equator) is about 6,378 km (3,963 miles). The polar radius is slightly smaller at 6,357 km (3,950 miles).

Earth’s surface is not smooth. Tectonic activity, erosion, volcanoes, and the movement of rocks create mountains, valleys, and trenches. The deepest place is the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, about 10,925 meters (35,843 feet) below sea level. The tallest mountain on land is Mount Everest, rising 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. But the place farthest from Earth’s center is not Everest, it is Chimborazo, a volcano in Ecuador. It is only 6,263 meters (20,548 feet) tall, but because it sits near the equator, where Earth bulges, its peak is 2 kilometers farther from the center than Everest.

Just like land has mountains and valleys, the oceans have their own shapes, but they are not solid. Ocean surfaces are always moving because of winds, tides, currents, gravity, and Earth’s spin. Some parts of the ocean are slightly higher because strong gravity pulls water toward denser rocks under the seafloor. Ocean currents are affected by the Coriolis effect, caused by Earth’s spin, creating big circular patterns called gyres. For example, in the Pacific Ocean, the surface in the western Pacific is about 60 centimeters (2 feet) higher than in the eastern Pacific because of trade winds and ocean circulation.

Scientists study Earth’s real shape in a field called geodesy. Instead of looking at uneven land and moving oceans, they use a model called the geoid. The geoid shows what Earth would look like if it were covered with perfectly still water, no waves, tides, or winds. The geoid is not a perfect sphere or simple oval. It is slightly bumpy, because some parts of Earth’s crust and mantle are denser, creating stronger gravity in those spots. The geoid is very useful because it acts as a baseline for measuring heights and depths, like how tall mountains are or how deep the oceans go. Today, satellites like GRACE and GOCE have mapped the geoid in incredible detail. They help scientists track important changes on Earth, like rising sea levels, melting ice sheets, and shrinking groundwater, with accuracy down to just a few centimeters.

Surface

thumb|upright=1.3|[[Terrain of Earth's crust]]
The surface of Earth is where land, oceans, and the atmosphere all meet. It is the part of the planet where life happens, plants grow, animals live, humans build cities, and water moves in rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Earth’s surface is very large, covering about 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles), giving plenty of space for ecosystems, farms, and people. We can divide Earth’s surface in two main ways. First is by latitude, which are lines that go east to west. This splits Earth into the Northern Hemisphere (above the equator) and the Southern Hemisphere (below the equator). Second is by longitude, which are lines that go north to south. This divides Earth into the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, using the Prime Meridian and the 180th meridian as rough dividing lines. These divisions help scientists and people understand climate, ocean currents, where plants and animals live, and also help with navigation and maps.

Most of Earth’s surface, about 70.8% or 361 million square kilometers (139 million square miles), is covered by oceans. This huge, connected body of water is called the world ocean, making Earth a true ocean world. The oceans are always moving, with currents, tides, and waves that help control climate and move nutrients that living things need. Long ago, oceans may have covered almost the entire planet, hiding the first land. Today, the world ocean is divided into five major oceans, from largest to smallest: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic Oceans. Under the oceans is oceanic crust, which forms deep basins and has many interesting features, like abyssal plains (flat areas), seamounts (underwater mountains), submarine volcanoes, ocean trenches, oceanic plateaus, mid-ocean ridges, where new crust forms from volcanic activity. In the polar regions, the ocean is covered by sea ice during part of the year. The ice, along with polar land and ice sheets, forms the polar ice caps, which affect how much sunlight Earth reflects back into space and also influence ocean currents.

The remaining 29.2% of Earth’s surface, about 149 million square kilometers (58 million square miles), is land. This includes continents and islands. The four biggest landmasses are Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica, and Australia. Land is divided into continents to make it easier to study geography and human cultures. Earth’s land is very diverse, with mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The lowest exposed point is the Dead Sea, 418 meters (1,371 feet) below sea level. The highest point is Mount Everest, which rises 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. On average, land sits about 797 meters (2,615 feet) above sea level, showing that most land is much lower than the tallest mountains but far above the ocean floors.

Earth’s land is made up of a mix of plants, water, snow, ice, and human buildings, which creates very different environments. Most land has vegetation, like forests and grasslands, which help hold soil in place and provide homes for animals. Some areas are much harsher: about 10% of land is covered by ice sheets, and about 33% is desert, where it is hard for most plants and animals to survive. The top layer of land is called the pedosphere, or soil. Soil forms from weathered rocks, decomposed plants and animals, and the cycling of minerals. Soil is very important because it supports ecosystems and growing food. Only about 10.7% of land can be used for farming crops (arable land), and about 1.3% is permanent cropland that grows food for people. Worldwide, there are around 16.7 million square kilometers (6.4 million square miles) of cropland and 33.5 million square kilometers (12.9 million square miles) of pastureland, which is used for grazing animals. These lands are essential for life on Earth.

Beneath the land and oceans is the Earth’s crust, the planet’s outer layer. Together with part of the upper mantle, it forms the lithosphere, which is the solid, rigid shell of Earth. The crust comes in two main types. The oceanic crust is thinner, heavier, and made mostly of basalt, a dark dense rock. It forms the ocean floors. The continental crust is thicker, lighter, and made of granite, as well as sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. It supports mountains and continents. Most of the continents are covered by sedimentary rocks, formed from material worn down from other rocks and deposited over time. These rocks cover about 75% of continental surfaces, but they only make up 5% of the crust’s total mass, showing that the surface does not fully represent what the crust is made of.

Orbit and turning
thumb|270px|Earth turns at an angle (an "[[axial tilt") in relation to its path around the Sun]]

Earth is one of the eight planets in the Solar System. There are also thousands of small bodies which move around the Sun. The Solar System is moving through the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, and will be for about the next 10,000 years.

Earth is about away from the Sun (this distance is called an "astronomical unit" or au. It moves on its orbit at an average speed of about . Earth turns around about 365 times in the time it takes for Earth to go all the way around the Sun. To make up this extra bit of a day every year, an additional day is added to the calendar every four years (29 February). A year that has this extra day is called a "leap year".

The Moon goes around Earth at an average distance of . It is locked to Earth, so that it always has the same half facing Earth; the other half is called the "dark side of the moon". It takes about 27 days for the Moon to go all the way around Earth, but because Earth is moving around the Sun at the same time, it takes about 29 days for the Moon to go from dark to bright to dark again. This is where the word "month" came from, even though most months now have 30 or 31 days.

Geology of Earth
thumb|right|Size of Earth compared with the other [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets in the Solar System: Mercury, Venus, and Mars]]

Earth is rocky. It is the largest of the rocky planets moving around the Sun by mass and by size. It is much smaller than the gas giants such as Jupiter.

Chemical make-up
Overall, Earth is made of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%). The 1.2% left over is made of many different kinds of other chemicals. Some rare metals (not just gold and platinum) are very valuable. Rare earth metals are often used in electronic phones and computers.

The structure of Earth changes from the inside to the outside. The center of Earth (Earth's core) is mostly iron (88.8%), nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% other elements. The Earth's crust is largely oxygen (47%). Oxygen is normally a gas but it can join with other chemicals to make compounds like water and rocks. 99.22% of rocks have oxygen in them. The most common rocks with oxygen are silica (made with silicon), alumina (made with aluminium), rust (made with iron), lime (made with calcium), magnesia (made with magnesium), potash (made with potassium), and sodium oxide.

Being rich in metals such as iron, the Earth is the densest of all the planets. Mercury and Venus are slightly less dense.

Shape
Earth's shape is a spheroid: not quite a sphere because it is slightly squashed on the top and bottom. The shape is called an oblate spheroid. As Earth spins around itself, centrifugal force forces the equator out a little and pulls the poles in a little. The equator, around the middle of Earth's surface, is about long. The reason the Earth is roughly a sphere (and so are all planets and stars) is gravity. Meteorites, on the other hand may be any shape because, in their case, the force of gravity is too weak to change their shape.

The highest mountain above sea level&mdash;the well-known Mount Everest (which is above sea level)&mdash;is not actually the one that is the farthest away from the center of the Earth. Instead, the sleeping volcano Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador is; it is only above sea level but it is almost at the equator. Because of this, Mount Chimborazo is from the center of the Earth, while Mount Everest is closer to it (). Similarly, the lowest point below sea level that we are conscious of is the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. It is about below sea level, but, again, there are probably places at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean that are nearer to the center of the Earth.

Earth’s core
thumb|right|220px|A picture of the inside of the Earth, showing the different levels. In fact, the air and the outside levels are much thinner than shown here

The deepest hole ever dug is only about . We know something about the inside of the Earth, because we learn things from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. We can detect how quickly shock waves move through the Earth.

The inside of Earth is very different from the outside. Almost all of Earth's liquid water is in the seas or close to the surface. The surface also has a lot of oxygen, which comes from plants. Small and simple kinds of life can live far under the surface, but animals and plants only live on the surface or in the seas. The rocks on the surface of Earth (Earth's crust) are well known. They are thicker where there is land, between thick. Under the seas they are sometimes only thick. 

There are three groups of rocks that make up most of the Earth's crust. Some rock is made when the hot liquid rock comes from inside the earth (igneous rocks); another type of rock is made when sediment is laid down, usually under the sea (sedimentary rocks); and a third kind of rock is made when the other two are changed by very high temperature or pressure (metamorphic rocks).

Below the crust is hot and almost-liquid rock which is always moving around (the Earth's mantle). Then, there is a thin liquid layer of heated rock (the outer core). This is very hot: . The middle of the inside of the Earth would be liquid as well but all the pressure of the rock above it makes it a solid. This solid middle part (the inner core) is almost all iron. It is what makes the Earth magnetic.

Pieces of the crust form plates
thumb|right|A [[map|picture showing the Earth's largest and most important plates.]]

The Earth's crust is solid but made of parts which move very slowly. The thin skin of hard rock on the outside of the Earth rests on hot liquid material below it in the deeper mantle. This liquid material moves because it gets heat from the hot center of the Earth. The slow movement of the plates is a factor in earthquakes, volcanoes and large groups of mountains on the Earth.

There are three ways plates can come together. Two plates can move towards each other ("convergent" plate edges). This can form islands, volcanoes, and high mountain ranges (such as the Andes and Himalayas). Two plates can move away from each other ("divergent" plate edges). This gives the warm liquid rock inside the earth a place to come out. This makes special mountain ranges below the sea or large low lands like Africa's Great Rift Valley. Plates are able to move beside each other as well ("transform" plate edges, such as the San Andreas Fault). This makes their edges crush against each other and makes many shocks as they move.

Surface
The outside of the Earth is not even. There are high places called mountains, and high flat places called plateaus or plateaux. There are low places called valleys and canyons. For the most part, moving air and water from the sky and seas eats away at rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces. The air and water then move these pieces to lower places. The fundamental cause of the differences in the Earth's surface is plate tectonics. The shape of the entire planet itself is not an exactly a ball. Because of its spin, Earth has a slight bulge at the Equator.

All places on Earth are made of, or are on top of, rocks. The outside of the Earth is usually not uncovered rock. Over 70% of the Earth is covered by seas full of salty water. This salty water makes up about 97% of all Earth's water. The drinkable fresh water is mostly in the form of ice. There is only a small amount (less than 3%) of fresh water in rivers and under the ground for people to drink. Gravity stops the water from going away into outer space. Also, much of the land on Earth is covered with plants, or with what is left from earlier living things. Places with very little rain are dry wastes called deserts. Deserts usually have few living things, but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have rainfall. Places with large amounts of rain may be rain forests. Lately, people have changed the environment of the Earth a great deal. As population has increased, so has farming. Farming is done on what were once natural forests and grassland.

Air

All around the Earth is the of air (the atmosphere). The mass of the Earth holds the gasses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space. The air is mostly made of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%) and there are a few other gasses as well. Living things need both the air and water.

The air, which animals and plants use to live, is only the first level of the air around the Earth (the troposphere). The day to day changes in this level of air are called weather; the larger differences between distant places, and from year to year, are called the climate. Rain and storms come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up. Cold air becomes thicker and falls, and warm air becomes thinner and goes up. The turning Earth also moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the Earth generally gets more power from the Sun and is warmer than the north and south points. Air over warm water evaporates but, because cold air is not able to take in as much water, it starts to make clouds and rain as it gets colder. The way water moves around in a circle like this is called the water cycle. In the past, the Earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now. Since people have adapted to the heat we have now, we do not want the Earth to be too much warmer or colder. Most of the ways people create electric power use burning kinds of carbon &ndash; especially coal, oil, and natural gas. Burning these fuels creates more carbon dioxide which causes more warming. A discussion is going on now about what people should do about the Earth's latest warming, which has gone on for about 150 years. So far, this warming has been acceptable: plants have grown better. The weather has generally been better than when it was colder.

== People == 

About eight billion people live on Earth. They live in about 200 different lands called countries. Some, for example, Russia, are large with many large cities. Others, for example, Vatican City, are small. The seven countries with the most people are India, China, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil and Nigeria. About 90% of people live in the northern hemisphere of the world, which has most of the land. Human beings originally came from Africa. Now, 70% of all people do not live in Africa but in Europe and Asia.
link= distribution of human [[world population in 2018]]

People change the Earth in many ways. They have been able to grow plants for food and clothes for about ten thousand years. When there was enough food, they were able to build towns and cities. Near these places, men and women were able to change rivers, bring water to farms, and stop floods (rising water) from coming over their land. People found useful animals and bred them so they were easier to keep.

Future
There is wide agreement that the long-term future of Earth is tied to the future of the Sun. As time passes, the Sun will get hotter, and that will eventually make the Earth a planet without life.

Et cetera
Et cetera means "and the rest" in Latin. It is typically used in English to continue a list longer than what can be written. The word et cetera is often written as etc.. It is also rarely written as &c, or &. It is the same as et ‒ formed by the joining of "e" and "t" into a single letter.

Examples

 "Jane has a lot of pets. She has cats, dogs, cows, horses, rabbits, kangaroos, etc."
 "Rocco ordered a lot of chips. He ordered cheese puffs, potato chips, Pringles, etc."
 "Robert ordered a large amount of groceries to stock for later. He ordered eggs, carrots, tomatoes, potatoes etc."

Experiment
An experiment is a test of an idea or a method. It is often used by scientists and engineers. An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world. Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them. Experiments are part of scientific method. Many experiments are controlled experiments or even blind experiments. Many are done in a laboratory. But thought experiments are done in mind.

Experiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When Einstein said that gravity could affect light, it took a few years before astronomers could test it. General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.

Now, a hundred years or so after Einstein published his ideas, there have been many tests, all of which have been consistent with Einstein's predictions. But, one day, we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work. What we test are implications of the theory, because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once.

"The universe does not tell us when we are right, only when we are wrong". – Karl Popper

Controlled experiments
A controlled experiment is a kind of comparison. It often compares the results from experimental samples against control samples. Control samples are the same as the experimental sample, except for one difference. This difference is the one thing whose effect is being tested (the independent variable). A good example would be a drug trial. The sample or group receiving the drug would be the experimental group (treatment group); and the one receiving the placebo or an older treatment would be the control group.

Difference with observational study
An observational study is used when an experiment would be difficult, unethical, or expensive. Observational studies are not experiments. Experiments can control for other variables, and it allows the researchers to change something. Observational studies often do not have random samples, and they often have many variables.

Famous experiments
 Galileo Galilei did some experiments about free fall (1623)
 Benjamin Franklin showed that lightning is a form of electricity (1752)
 The Michelson–Morley experiment proved a flaw in old physics, and prompted Einstein's work (1887)
 Ivan Pavlov did some experiments about the classical conditioning of dogs (1927)
 The Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment proved DNA was the molecule which caused heredity (1944)
 Stanley Milgram showed that people follow orders; this became known as the Milgram experiment (1961)

Ethics
Ethics is the study of good and bad behavior. It is one of the main parts of philosophy. Ethics tries to answer questions like:

 What actions are good? What actions are evil?
 How can we tell the difference?
 Are good and evil the same?
 How should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other people?
 How do our actions affect others?

Ideas about ethics
When discussing ethics, the philosophy is generally separated into:
 thinking about morality,
 the involvement of science, 
 the freedom of people to decide for themselves how to act within their own beliefs.

Morality is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad. There are many different moralities, but they share some things. For example, most people think that murder (killing somebody) is wrong. (compare Exodus 20:13) Some philosophers hope to find more things that moralities share. They think that ethics should use the scientific method to study things that people think are good or bad. Their work can be used to test the fairness of a situation, such as how people should treat each other. An example of this kind of thinking is the categorical imperative. Many countries have laws based on this idea of fairness.

What is ethics used for?
Understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices. Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics.

Ethics is part of other fields of study in many ways. Here are some ways:

 Ethics is part of the study of religion. In religion, people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about God (or gods). Some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion. See Ten Commandments.
 Some theories of economics say ethics has to do with money. Money is a big part of most people's lives. Thinking about morality can be important in economics. For example, there is a saying about ethics taken from the Bible that 'the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil' (1 Timothy).The philosophy of Marxism also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people.
 Government policy can be affected by what politicians think is ethical. Politicians try to create laws that help everyone do what is right. Political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right.
 In work, thinking about ethics can help with hard questions. Work can be like both economics and politics. Workers have to make money and follow laws. But the best way to do both is not always easy to know. The study of this is called business ethics
 People like doctors and nurses have to make hard choices about how to care for people. Sometimes the person being cared for, their family or the doctor do not agree what is best for them. Also, choices have to be made if there are enough resources to help all. The study of this is called medical ethics. Similar studies for specific professions include bioethics and legal ethics.
 Discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war. By talking about ethics, people hope to get what they want without being violent. This works when all people agree that peace is very important. But not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong. So, sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without fighting.

Along with aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology, the philosophy of what people like.

E Prime
E Prime (it means English Prime) defines a way of speaking English without using the verb "to be" in any way ("be, is, am, are, was, were, been, and being"). Instead, an E Prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like "to become," "to remain," and "to equal" or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the "thing" does not actually "act". For example, in E Prime, a writer would change the statement "Mistakes were made" to "Joe made mistakes." This change in wording reveals an actor (Joe) where the previous form concealed the actor. Users of E Prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate.

What E Prime is
D. David Bourland, Jr. first suggested E Prime in 1965. Bourland had studied the discipline (way of thinking) of General Semantics. The main idea of General Semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see, hear, touch, taste, smell, think, and feel, and furthermore, that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future. Because each person has different experiences throughout their lives, they interpret their experiences differently. 

Students of General Semantics and users of E Prime contend that to say "This cat is soft" leaves out many other attributes, and implies that the outside "object" of the cat is the "same as" the inside experience of "softness". Instead, E Prime users say "This cat feels soft TO ME" to remind themselves of the following:
That their experience of "softness" involves both the outside "object" called "cat" and the eyes, hands, brain and nervous system of the observer.
 That someone else might experience different aspects of the cat.
 That they themselves might experience something different at a different time or in different circumstances. (The cat might scratch them, or look or feel wet or matted with dirt.)

What E Prime is not
Although languages like Russian, Arabic, Turkish, and Cantonese do not always use a separate verb for "to be," they do have the idea of "being." For example, an English speaker might say "This apple is red." An Arabic speaker might say "This apple red." Most languages can be used to express the idea of a red apple. An E Prime user chooses to say "This apple looks red to me" to remind themselves that "seeing red" involves both the apple and the eye and brain of the person looking at the apple.

Many teachers of English encourage students to use verbs other than "to be." To them, using more active verbs makes writing clearer and more interesting. These teachers want to improve their students' writing and may not agree with the ideas of General Semantics or E Prime.

Different functions of 'to be'
In English, 'to be' can have different functions:
It talks about identity: The cat is my only pet, The cat is Garfield
It talks about belonging to a class, or a group: The cat is an animal
It can talk about properties: The cat is furry
It can be an auxiliary verb: The cat is sleeping, The cat is bitten by the dog
It can talk about existence: There is a cat
It can talk about location: The cat is here

Einstein on the Beach
Einstein on the Beach is an opera written by the minimalist composer Philip Glass and theater director and designer Robert Wilson. It was first acted for an audience in Avignon, France in 1976. 

It is a single act opera, about five hours long with no intermission. Because of the length and the minimalist (repetitive) nature of the music, audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish. Glass's music tends to cycle round, but does not exactly repeat itself. Admittedly, he has described himself as a composer of "music with repetitive structures". Though his earlier music fits what is normally called "minimalist", he has since evolved stylistically.

Ethnic group
An ethnic group is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some or multiple ways. They may all have the same ancestors, speak the same language, or have the same culture, which could sometimes include religion. They often live in the same or surrounding area.

Sometimes almost all of the people in one country are of the same ethnic group, but not always. Often one country may have several different ethnic groups, or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ensures the rights of ethnic groups in Article 27 and also gives them the right to use their own language.

An example of an ethnic group is the Slavic peoples and Roma people.

Ebola virus
| ICD9 = 
| MedlinePlus = 001339
| eMedicineSubj = med
| eMedicineTopic = 626
| MeshID = D019142}}

Ebola virus or Ebola virus disease (EVD), often shortened to Ebola, is a very dangerous virus. It belongs to the family Filoviridae. Four different types of Ebola virus can cause a severe disease which is often fatal. Ebola infection causes hemorrhagic fever which starts suddenly. "Hemorrhagic" means that the victim will bleed a lot, inside and outside of their body. The virus attacks almost every organ and tissue of the human body, causing multiple organs to fail at once. Out of every 100 people who get Ebola, on average 25 to 90 die.

The virus was first found in Sudan. It is mostly found in Africa, with very few cases in Europe and the United States.

Transmission
thumb|264x264px|A 3D medical animation still of Ebola Virus
The Ebola virus that makes people sick lives in the blood and other liquids and organs in some kinds of non-human animals without killing them. Scientists think the animals it lives in are mainly some kinds of monkeys or fruit bats. When people touch animals that have the virus, or secretions that came out of those animals, they can get sick.

Ebola cannot be caught through the air, or by being near sick people. The virus can only go from liquids into people's bodies. This means Ebola can be caught by touching a sick person's blood, saliva, mucus, semen, diarrhea, vomit, or other fluids that come out of a sick person's body.

If a person does not die from the disease, he can still give other people the infection by having sex for nearly another two months after they stop being sick. This is because the virus can still be in the man's semen after a long time.<!-- When people get Ebola, the first symptoms may look like other diseases. People may develop "dry" symptoms such as fever, fatigue, weakness, sore throat, joint pain and headache. Sometimes, people think they may have malaria or typhoid fever.

Eventually, individuals get much sicker and experience "wet" symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and belly pain. They may also start to have unexplained bleeding inside and outside the body which can include having blood in the stool, blood in vomit.As the disease progresses, people can go into shock from excess fluid loss, which means low blood pressure, fast pulse (heart rate), and low blood circulation to the body leading to organ failure.

Treatment
Currently there are two medications approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat Ebola Disease: Inmazeb and Ebanga. These medications are made up of monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein that are made in the lab. When these medications are used to treat Ebola, they help the body's natural defense system to stop the virus from multiplying in the body. 

People with Ebola also need supportive care to relieve symptoms. Lots of fluid and electrolytes are given to replace the fluids lost from diarrhea, vomiting, and bleeding. Fluid can be given by mouth or through an IV which is a special tube that goes into veins the arm. This process of giving fluid back into the body is called fluid replacement therapy. It is also important to give blood transfusions and medicine in the case of low blood pressure which is a complication of fluid loss. Medicines can also be given to stop vomiting and diarrhea and to help reduce fever and pain.

Prevention
To prevent the spread of the Ebola virus during ongoing outbreaks, it is important to practice hand washing and avoid coming into close contact with the body fluids of infected individuals.This includes blood, tears, saliva, semen, sweat, vomit, urine, feces, breast milk and fluid from infected women during labor. In addition, people should avoid contact with items that may have been contaminated with body fluids such as, utensils, clothes, bedding, needles, and medical tools. Individuals with the virus can be separated from those without the virus to reduce the spread of the disease. When in close contact with a person infected with the virus, it is recommended to wear special protective clothing known as personal protective equipment (PPE). The personal protective equipment requires wearing gloves, gowns, protective eye wear, masks and closed-toe shoes. 

Many Ebola vaccine candidates had been developed in the decade prior to the West African Ebola epidemic in 2014, but none had yet been approved for use in humans. The Ebola Zaire vaccine also known by its brand name ERVEBO was the first vaccine approved by the FDA in December 2019.The vaccine helps to protect against the Zaire Ebola virus, one of the virus types that causes deadly Ebola Disease. ERVEBO is a single dose vaccine and is safe for individuals aged 12 months and older who at risk of infection. Although the vaccine has been given to pregnant and breastfeeding women in past outbreaks, the vaccine has not been approved for these specific groups. Several countries in Africa have successfully used the vaccine since it was approved including Zambia, Burundi, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. 

Another approved vaccine is Zabdeno / Mvabea. This vaccine is a combination vaccine also used against the Zaire Ebola virus.

Ecology
thumb|250px|Biotic pollination vector
Ecology is the branch or aspect of biology that studies the biota (living things), the environment, and their interactions. It comes from the Greek oikos = house; logos = study. 

Ecology is the study of ecosystems. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of biodiversity, ecologists research everything from tiny bacteria in nutrient recycling to the effects of tropical rain forests on the Earth's atmosphere. Scientists who study these interactions are called ecologists. 

Terrestrial ecoregion and climate change research are two areas where ecologists now focus.

There are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management (agriculture, forestry, fisheries), city planning (urban ecology), community health, economics, and applied science. It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction.

Population ecology

thumb|A graph of a population which reaches carrying capacity
Population ecology measures the size of a population: all the living things from one species that live in an place. A population gets bigger because of birth and movement into a place, and it gets smaller because of death and movement out of a place. Growth rate is the change in population size divided by the current population size. When a population is small, growth rate does not change, so the population shows exponential growth. Rate of exponential growth depends on how a living thing reproduces. If it has only a few offspring (children) which grow slowly, like a human, the rate will be low. If it has a lot of offspring which grow quickly, like a fruit fly, the rate will be high. Any environment only has enough natural resources, such as food, water, or space, for a certain size of population. This size is called the carrying capacity. When population size is near the carrying capacity, growth rate will become less. The graph of population growth will be an S-shape, called logistic growth.

Community and ecosystem ecology
thumb|A soil food web
A community is all populations of different species that live in the same place. An ecosystem is a community and its environment. Ecosystem ecology studies how energy and nutrients move through an ecosystem. All living things need energy to survive, move, grow, and reproduce. A trophic level is the number of times energy moves from one living thing to another, before reaching a particular living thing. The first trophic level, called producers or autotrophs, gets energy from the environment. They use the energy to make organic compounds. Most producers, such as plants, take in energy from sunlight, but some take it from inorganic compounds. Other trophic levels, called consumers or heterotrophs, get their energy by eating other living things. All animals are consumers, and there are three kinds: herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. Herbivores eat only plants, carnivores eat only other animals, and omnivores eat both. Decomposers are living things which break down dead things. A food web shows the movement of energy in an ecosystem.

Humans and ecology
Ecology in politics
Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements - including the conservation movement, wellness movement, environmental movement, and ecology movement we know today. When these are combined with peace movements and the Six Principles, they are called green movements. In general, these put ecosystem health first on a list of human moral and political priorities, as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony, and better economics. 

People with these beliefs are called political ecologists. Some have organized into the Green Parties, but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties. They very often use arguments from ecology to advance policy, especially forest policy and energy policy.

Also, ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment, including other organisms.

Ecology includes economics
Many ecologists also deal with human economics:

 Lynn Margulis says that economics studies how humans make a living, while ecology studies how every other animal makes a living.
 Mike Nickerson says that "economy is three-fifths of ecology", since ecosystems create resources and dispose of waste, which the economy assumes is done "for free".

Ecological economics and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others, but it is difficult. Many people think economics is just part of ecology now, and that economics that ignores it is wrong. "Natural capital" is an example of one theory combining both.

Ecology and anthropology
Sometimes ecology is compared to anthropology. Anthropology includes how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment, while ecology includes how our environment is affected by our bodies and minds. There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology, which studies how people interact with the environment. 

Antoine de Saint-Exupery stated: "The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books. Because it resists us. Man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle".

Economics

Economics is the social science which studies economic activity: how people make choices to get what they want. It has been defined as "the study of scarcity and choice" and is basically about the choices people make. It also studies what affects the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in an economy.

Investment and income relate to economics. The word comes from Ancient Greek, and relates to οἶκος oíkos "house" and νόμος nomos "custom" or "law". The models used in economics today were mostly started in the 19th century. People took ideas from political economy and added to them because they wanted to use an empirical approach similar to the one used in the natural sciences.

Subjects and objects in economics
The subjects (actors) in economic study are households, business companies, the government (the state), and foreign countries. Households offer their "factors of production" to companies. This includes labor, land, capital (things like machines and buildings) and information. In exchange for their factors of production, households get income which they use to consume (buy) goods from firms representing consumption expenditure. 

Business companies produce and sell goods and services and buy factors of production from households and from other companies. 

The state or public sector includes institutions and organisations. The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households, and uses it to pay for "public goods" like street lights or defense systems, to be available for everyone. The last subject is foreign countries. This includes all households, business companies and state institutions, which are not based in one's own country. They demand and supply goods from abroad.

The objects (things acted upon) in economic study are consumer goods, capital goods, and factors of production. Consumer goods are classified as "usage goods" (for example, gasoline or toilet paper), as "purpose goods" (for example, a house or bicycle), and as "services" (for example, the work of a doctor or cleaning lady). Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods. Examples of these are buildings, equipment, and machines. Factors of production are work, ground, capital, information, and environment.

General economic rules
 All people have to decide between their options.
 The cost of goods is what a person gives up for the goods.
 When a person gives up something (like money) to get a good, they also give up other things that they could have gotten instead. This means that the true cost of something is what you give up to get it. This includes money, and the economic benefits ("utility") that you didn't get because you can no longer buy something else.This is called opportunity cost.
 People choose between options based on the rewards ("incentives") or bad things ("disincentives") they expect from each option. Adding to the rewards for an option will often make more people choose it.
 Trade can make everyone better off.
 Markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life. In the free market, goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions. The “invisible hand” of the market (Adam Smith) states that if everyone tries to get what they want, everyone will be as well-off as they could possibly be.
 Sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society. For example, air pollution is bad for society, and education is good for society. The government can put a tax (or do something to reduce sales) on items that are bad for society. It can also support (like giving money for) items that are good for society.
 The living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods. Productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours. 
 When there is an increase in the total money supply, or when the cost to produce things rises, prices go up. This is called inflation.

 Physiocracy
 Classical economics
 Marxist economics
 Austrian economics
 Neoclassical economics
 Welfare economics

The ideas that economists have depend a lot on the times they live in. For example, Karl Marx lived in a time when workers' conditions were very poor, and John Maynard Keynes lived through the Great Depression of the 1930s. Today's economists can look back and understand why they made their judgments, and try to make better ones.

Branches of economics
The two main branches of economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics. 

Macroeconomics is about the economy in general. For example, macroeconomists study things that make a country's wealth go up and things that make millions of people lose their jobs. Microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money and how businesses operate.

There are a number of other branches of economics:

 Behavioral economics
 Business economics
 Constitutional economics
 Cultural economics
 Development economics
 Ecological economics

thumb|[[Bromine is one of only two elements that are liquid at 25°C. The other is Mercury and the others can only be made in laboratories. The human body is made up of 26 elements. The first man-made element was technetium, in 1937.

Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the periodic table. Where the elements are in the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements.

Chemical symbols
Chemical elements are given a unique chemical symbol. Chemical symbols are used all over the world. This means that, no matter which language is spoken, there is no confusion about what the symbol means. 'Au' is the symbol for gold and it comes from the Latin word for gold, aurum. Another symbol which comes from Latin is 'Ag'. This is the element silver and it comes from the Latin argentum. An isotope is a form of an element with a certain number of neutrons. For example, carbon has two stable, naturally occurring isotopes: carbon-12 (6 neutrons) and carbon-13 (7 neutrons). Carbon-14 (8 neutrons) is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon. At least two isotopes of each element are known (except for Oganesson, of which only a few atoms have been made).

Classification
Elements can be classified based on physical states. At room temperature and pressure, most elements are solids, only 11 are gases and 2 are liquids.

Elements can also be classified into metals and non-metals. There are many more metals than non-metals.

However, a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non-metals. These elements are called semimetals (or metalloids).

History
Ancient Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country in the world as it used to be ruled by pharaohs. As a province of the Roman Empire, it became Christian and some Copts remained despite over a thousand years of Muslim rule. The Fatimid Caliphate ruled Egypt in the tenth through twelfth centuries. Mamlukes ruled it until 1798 when Napoleon defeated them. Muhammad Ali Pasha soon took over and started a dynasty of Khedives under the Ottoman Empire. The Empire fell apart after World War I. Egypt became an independent country in 1922 and the khedive became a king. Egypt is a member of the United Nations and the Arab League. It became a republic after the Army's revolution of 1952.

Geography
Egypt is a large country, but a large portion of it is desert. Most people (95% of Egypt's total people) live in areas around the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and along the Nile River. This includes the cities of Cairo, Alexandria, Aswan, and Port Said. Not many people live in the desert. Today, Egypt has about 90 million people.

Egypt is divided into 29 areas, called Governorates of Egypt.

Politics
Egypt is a country that has had many different rulers and many political systems. After World War II, Egypt was still ruled by a king, Farouk of Egypt (11 February 1920 – 18 March 1965). He was the last ruler of the Muhammad Ali dynasty.

Farouk was overthrown on 23 July 1952 by a military coup. The coup was led by Muhammad Naguib, and Gamal Abdel Nasser. From then on, Egypt had military rulers or rulers who had the backing of the army and many citizens.

Nasser became president, from 1956 to 1970. Later rulers were Anwar Sadat, and Hosni Mubarak.

Abdel Fattah el-Sisi became president in 2014.

Revolution of 2011

In January 2011, thousands of protesters gathered in Cairo. They wanted Hosni Mubarak to leave office. He had been the President for almost 30 years. On February 11, 2011, Vice President Omar Suleiman made an announcement. He said that Mubarak agreed to leave office. In 2012, Egypt had a democratic election for the post of President. The winner was the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, Mohamed Morsi.

The events which followed are still controversial, but one aspect stands out. Morsi issued a declaration that in effect gave him unlimited powers. He had the power to legislate (make laws) without legal overview by the courts. This caused widespread protests. On 3 July 2013, he was unseated by a military coup council (a coup d'état). After an election in June 2014, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi became President of Egypt. Islamist movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, rejected the change of regime as a military coup, and not democratic.

Demographics
Religion
Today, the people of Egypt are mostly Sunni Muslims. There are many Christians in Egypt today. Many of these belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.

Languages
The official language in Egypt is Arabic. The majority speak Egyptian Arabic but many speak other dialects. Some Egyptians still speak Coptic and English. They also speak French and German in Egypt. These are taught in Egypt as additional languages.

Famous people
Many famous people are from Egypt. Some of these include Omar Sharif, who was an international actor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was the first person from Africa to lead the United Nations, and four Nobel Prize winners: Anwar Sadat, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978, Naguib Mahfouz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988, Ahmed Zewail, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999, and Mohamed ElBaradei, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. Mohamed Salah is a famous footballer who plays for Liverpool in England. A famous Egyptian singer is called Amr Diab.

Governorates
Egypt is divided into 27 governorates. The governorates are divided into regions. The regions have towns and villages. Each governorate has a capital. Sometimes capital has the same name as the governorate.

Culture

Egypt is a country with an immense cultural mix. Life in the countryside differs from life in large cities. There are differences between the families which are Muslim, and the smaller number which are Coptic Christians. There are noticeable differences in the standards of education.

Tourism
thumb|Pyramid of Menkaure|236x236px
Tourism is one of the most important national incomes in Egypt. In 2008, about 12 million tourists visited Egypt providing nearly $12 billion of national income to Egypt. Tourism affects the economy of the country as a whole.

Giza Necropolis is one of Egypt's iconic sites. It is a popular destination for tourists to visit. It includes the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

Transport
There are methods of transport in Egypt. The Suez Canal carries ships of many countries.

thumb|238x238px|Cairo Metro, Sadat Station
Cairo Metro is one of the most important projects in Egypt. It consists of 3 lines. Metro is the most preferable transport in Egypt due to persistent major traffic jams in the streets of Cairo. Metro line 4 is being developed to reach the New Cairo District.

Egypt established EgyptAir in 1932. The airline is based in Cairo International Airport and is owned by the Egyptian government

Egyptian Armed Forces
The Egyptian Armed Forces are the defense forces of the Republic of Egypt. They consist of the Egyptian Air Force, Egyptian Navy, Egyptian Army, and the Egyptian Air Defense Forces. It is ranked 8th in the world. It is the strongest military force in the Arab world and Africa.

Everything2
Everything2 or E2 is a website. It lets people make pages about many different things, and some people use it as a diary.

E2 users create pages called nodes and add stuff in writeups. Only logged-in users can create writeups. Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners (called "gods") choose can edit the writeup. On the other hand, on Wikipedia, anyone can edit pages, but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages.

Everything2 does not require a neutral point of view like Wikipedia does. So, it is possible to have more than one article (writeups) under the same title (node), each by different authors, and presenting different points of view.

Editor
An Editor is a person who makes edits (changes) to documents.

More specifically the word editor can mean:
 a person who changes texts; see copy editing.
 a newspaper or magazine editor is a person who prepares articles for printing and sometimes chooses which articles to put in the newspaper. The main editor of a newspaper or magazine is called the "editor-in chief".
 a Wikipedia user who makes changes (also called "edits") to pages (articles, templates, categories, etc)
 text editor, an application program for editing an electronic text or media document
 one who, or that which, edits photos
 film editor, a person who edits movies
 a human or machine for movie film or video editing

Ecological yield
Ecological yield is the harvestable growth of an ecosystem. It is most commonly measured in forestry - in fact sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest.

However, the concept is also applicable to water, and soil, and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called renewable resources. The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is "renewed" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt).

Experience economy
The experience economy is the intangible service economy that customers experience directly. In moral purchasing, Natural Capitalism and other theories of how consumers make choices, they are actually choosing experiences or comprehensive outcomes of their choices. For instance to buy local is to choose a whole experience of local suppliers, such as in a farmers market or Slow Food, that is quite different than the experience associated with factory food or fast food.

Execution
Execution is where state authorities kill someone for having committed an extremely serious crime, usually treason or especially terrible murders. In most countries where the death penalty is still provided for by law, using it is an option available to the sentencing judge: even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty, the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in a prison for the rest of their life. A person whose job is to execute others is an executioner.
Beheading
thumb|[[Lady Jane Grey, a probably innocent Queen of England is beheaded.]]
thumb|[[Anne Boleyn, executed for adultery]]

Beheading means cutting the person's head off. It is one of the oldest execution methods and mentioned in the Bible. Beheading used to be the standard method of execution in Scandinavia and Germany. Commoners were usually beheaded with an axe and noblemen with a sword. A special device, like the guillotine, may be used, as in France. Nazi Germany used the guillotine to execute criminal convicts, such as murderers.

Many countries formerly used beheading as an execution for important people, including England. In England, many noblemen and even some kings and queens have been beheaded. There, the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and might be allowed a last speech. Then, he/she would be blindfolded and put his/her neck onto a block. Then, the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victim's neck. If the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp, then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke. But if the executioner was inexperienced, then it might take several strokes before the head was cut off.

Other ways of execution
thumb|The Execution of Emperor Maximilan of Mexico is a painting by [[Edouard Manet. It shows a firing squad.]]
Many countries do not allow executions as punishment any more, because it is too violent or immoral. However, many states of the United States and some other countries use it. In the United States, less violent ways of execution are used than in the past. Here are some ways of executing people:

 Hanging: Using a rope to either break the convict's neck or to choke (or strangle) them. Widely used around the world until the 20th century. Still today in use in some countries, such as Iraq, Singapore and Japan.
 Firing Squad: Several people shoot and kill a person. Armies around the world have long used this method, since guns and bullets are readily available. Firing squad was the lawful means of execution in Finland until 1944, when death penalty was abolished (stopped by the law). It was also used in the state of Utah in the 20th century. In most cases, not all the shooters have real bullets. After the execution, it is not possible to determine which of the people firing killed the person just executed.
 Gas chamber: killing a person by filling the air in a room with poison gas until the person cannot breathe and dies. This method was used for executions in some U.S. states, and for mass murder by the Schutzstaffel during the Holocaust.

Lethal injection: Killing a person by placing poisons into their bloodstream. This is the choice of execution in most U.S. states that allow executions.
Electrocution: Killing a person by placing them in an electric chair and giving them a very high electric shock.

Old-fashioned methods
Crucifixion: a person (or their corpse) is fixed to a timber by nails or by impalement. The Romans used crucifixion to punish traitors, rebels and runaway slaves because the Romans considered it the most unpleasant death. Death by this method may take days. Besides ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and the Persian empires, this method was also used in feudal Japan.
Drawing and Quartering: A violent form of execution common in Medieval and Renaissance Europe. It involved taking a person's organs out while they were still alive.
Breaking on the wheel: the executioner breaks all the bones of a person's limbs with a heavy object. The executioner wraps the person's limbs around a wheel from a carriage, and lifts the wheel to the top of a tall pole. Slowly, the person dies.
Crushing, also called pressing: used in the common law legal systems. A defendant who refused to plead ("stood mute") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon their chest until a plea was entered or the person suffocated.
Garroting, a method of strangulation used in Spain for hundreds of years.

Flesch Reading Ease
The Flesch Reading Ease (FRES) score says how easy something is to read. J. Peter Kincaid and others made this formula for the U.S. Navy in 1975.

How it works
The FRES test works by counting the number of words, syllables, and sentences in the text. It then calculates the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables per word. The idea is that shorter words and shorter sentences are easier to read. The higher the score, the easier the text is to understand. The formula is:

206.835 - 1.015 \left( \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{total sentences}} \right) - 84.6 \left( \frac{\text{total syllables}}{\text{total words}} \right)

Some points of reference for the score are:

The highest score possible is 121.22. It is gained if every sentence only has a one-syllable word.
"The cat sat on the mat" scores 116. There is no lower limit to this score. Some very complicated
sentences can have negative scores.

The Flesch score is usually lower for technical documentation because the topic itself is complicated.
Someone who uses the test regularly will develop a sense of a reasonable score for this type of writing.
They can then aim to align with this score.

The Flesch score for this subsection is 74.

February
February (Feb.) is the second month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, coming between January and March. It has 28 days in common years, and 29 days in leap years. This was to make the calendar match to the rest of the world. In 1930 and 1931, February had 30 days in the Soviet Union because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long. The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from "februa", the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month.

February begins on the same day of the week as March and November in common years, and August in leap years. February always ends on the same day of the week as October, and additionally, January in common years.

The Month
thumb|200px|right|Chocolates for [[Valentine's Day, February 14.]]
February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar at the beginning of the year (the other is January). This is because in the original Roman calendar, the two months of winter, when not much would happen in agriculture, did not have names.

February is the second month of the year, coming between January and March, and is also the shortest month, with 28 days in a common year, and 29 days in a leap year. 

February begins on the same day of the week as March and November in common years and on the same day of the week as August in leap years. February ends on the same day of the week as January in common years and October every year, as each other's last days are exactly 4 weeks (28 days) and 35 weeks (245 days) apart respectively. In a leap year, February is the only month to both begin and end on the same day of the week.

Every year, February starts on the same day of the week as June of the previous year, as each other's first days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In common years, February finishes on the same day of the week as May of the previous year, and in leap years, August and November of the previous year.

In common years immediately before other common years, February starts on the same day of the week as August of the following year, and in leap years and years immediately before that, May of the following year. In years immediately before common years, February finishes on the same day of the week as July of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, April and December of the following year.

February is also the only month of the calendar that, once every six years and twice every 11 years consecutively, either back into the past or forward into the future, will have four full 7-day weeks. In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday, this was observed in 2021 and can be traced back 11 years to 2010, 11 years back to 1999, 6 years back to 1993, 11 years back to 1982, 11 years back to 1971 and 6 years back to 1965, and will be observed again in 2027 In countries that start their week on a Sunday, it occurs in a common year starting on Thursday, with the next occurrence in 2026, and previous occurrences in 2015 (11 years earlier than 2026), 2009 (6 years earlier than 2015), 1998 (11 years earlier than 2009) and 1987 (11 years earlier than 1998). This works unless the pattern is broken by a skipped leap year, but no leap year has been skipped since 1900 and no others will be skipped until 2100.

From circa 700&nbsp;BC, when Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, added it to the calendar, February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year, until 46&nbsp;BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise. Leap year Day, February 29, is added in every year that can be divided equally by four, such as 2012 and 2016, but this does not apply when the year ending in "00" at the turn of the century does not divide equally into 400. This means that 1600 and 2000 were leap years in the Gregorian calendar, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were rather common years. This is where the Julian calendar calculated dates differently, as it always repeated February 29 every four years.

February is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of August in the other. In weather lore, Groundhog Day, in the United States, is set to decide what the weather will be like for the rest of the winter.

February's flower is the violet and its birthstone is the amethyst. The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity. The zodiac signs for February are Aquarius (January 21 to February 19), and Pisces (February 20 to March 20).

Financial capital
Financial capital is a form of capital. It is things that have value, but do not do anything by themselves. They are only valuable because people value (want) them. For example, money is a form of financial capital. You cannot do anything with money but it still has value.

Financial capital is used to pay for things, this is because there is always more of it and people always want it. This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people.

Some forms of financial capital, such as stocks, gold or bonds are not wanted by everybody. However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital. Because of this, these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price. This means that some people try to make a profit by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a market.

Some things are treated as financial capital, even though they do have a use. For example, some people buy and sell land but are not interested in doing anything with it. Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money. Other types of capital, such as social capital and human capital are rarely treated like financial capital. This may be because they involve people. Treating useful capital like financial capital is called comodification.

In politics, a common question is how often the government should use financial capital. In particular, should the government use financial capital to make a profit? Traditionally, liberal politicians do not mind this kind of trading for profit, but socialist or conservative politicians are against it.

Fecund universes
thumb|Lee Smolin, creator of the Fecund universes theory
Fecund universes is a multiverse theory of Lee Smolin. It relies on models of our universe and statistics from astrophysics but is more correctly a theory of cosmology.

In this theory, collapsing stars, or black holes, are always creating new universes with slightly different laws of physics. Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a mutation of the original universe, as if each universe was a kind of single-celled organism. It would reproduce by "splitting" in some sense.

This theory relies on many models of our universe to model these "mutated" alternative universes, the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or "spun off" by black holes. 

No human can ever be part of any of these "other" universes. Observations from astrophysics can only say if the black holes exist or are common, and give some idea of how much the laws of physics can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes. 

Smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see, since they are likely in a very late born universe, by simple probability. If there are many black holes, that is evidence for his theory, 

As this shows, cosmology has a very different standard of evidence and burden of proof than is required for models of our universe only, which humans (using mathematics) can observe and exchange knowledge on.

It is hard to separate science from religion on such questions. It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one's universe as part of a system like biology or like mechanics - clockwork. Smolin's theory is important mostly because it challenges the mechanistic paradigm. 

Even if it is wrong, it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all. Some compare Smolin's theory to Gaia philosophy which combines biology, geology and ecology to explain the Earth, our planet, as a living thing. If both are right, humans are on a living planet in a living universe. This idea is very appealing - which does not mean it is really "right".

Food
thumb|200px|Different kinds of foods.
thumb|Joachim Beuckelaer, 1560-1565
thumb|A slice of [[Pizza.]]
Food is what people, plants and animals eat to live. Every organism needs energy to carry on with the process of living which comes from food. Food usually comes from animals and plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition. Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is normally enjoyable to humans.

It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, water and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called "drinks". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry and could die.

Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism.

Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be changed by industrial processes (the food industry). Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and food additives (such as preservatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers, flavor enhancers). For example, bread is processed food.

Food processing at home is done in the kitchen, by the cook. The cook sometimes uses a cookbook. Examples of cooking utensils are pressure cookers, pots, and frying pans.

Food can also be prepared and served in restaurants or refectory (in particular for children in school).

The utensils used may be a plate, knife, fork, chopsticks, spoon, bowl, or spork.

Many people do not grow their own food. They have to buy food that was grown by someone else. People buy most of their food in shops or markets. But some people still grow most or all of their own food.

People may buy food and take it home to cook it. They may buy food that is ready to eat from a street vendor or a restaurant.

Other countries have their own way of eating food. An example of an ethnic food is Mexican food.

Production of food
Originally, people got food as hunter-gatherers. The agricultural revolution changed that. Farmers grew crops including those invented and improved by selective breeding. These improvements, for example the invention of maize, allowed feeding more people, and further improvements gave it a better taste.

Food shortage has been a big problem throughout history. Many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need. Bad weather or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world. When people do not have enough food, we say that they are hungry. If they do not eat enough food for a long time, they will become sick and die from starvation. In areas where many people do not have enough food, we say that there is famine there.

Food and water can make people sick if it is contaminated by microorganisms, bad metals, or chemicals.

If people do not eat the right foods, they can become sick.
 If people do not eat enough protein, they get the disease called kwashiorkor.
 If they do not eat enough vitamin B1 (thiamine), they get the disease called beriberi.
 If they do not eat enough vitamin C, they get the disease called scurvy.
 If children do not eat enough vitamin D, they get the disease called rickets.

People may often have a variety of eating disorders that cause them to either eat too much, or not be able to eat certain things or amounts. Common diseases like Coeliac disease or food allergies cause people to experience ill effects from consuming certain foods that are normally safe. If people eat too much food, they can become overweight or obese. This causes numerous health problems. On the other hand, eating too little food, from lack of access or anorexia could cause malnutrition. Therefore, people have to balance the amount, the nutrition, and the type of food to be healthy.

Food in religions
Many cultures or religions have food taboos. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has to be prepared. Examples of religious food rules are the Kashrut of Judaism and the Halal of Islam, that say that pig meat cannot be eaten. In Hinduism, eating beef is not allowed. Some Christians are vegetarian (someone who does not eat meat) because of their religious beliefs. For example, Seventh-day Adventist Church recommends vegetarianism.

In addition, sometime beliefs do not relate to the religion but belong to the culture. For example, some people pay respect to Guān Yīn mothergod and those followers will not consume "beef" as they believe that her father has a shape of the cow.

Fine
thumb

If someone is found guilty of a crime, their punishment may be to pay a fine, a certain amount of money. In many countries, fines can be ordered by police, court judges and some government officers.

When agreeing to a contract with a business, a customer may agree to certain rules. If the customer breaks the rules, then they agree to pay a fine for doing so. For example, when somebody hires a car and agrees to return it by Friday, they agree that if they do not return the car by Friday, they must pay a $50 fine to the business.

Frying
Frying is cooking food in hot butter or vegetable oil or other fat. We can fry food in a small amount of fat in a pan or in a lot of oil in a pot. Some restaurants use deep frying to fry a large amount of food.

Fish (plural: fish or fishes) are a group of animals which live in water and respire (get oxygen) from their gills. As a group, they are much older than other vertebrates. The first fish developed about 500 million years ago.

Shell fish such as the crab or lobster are actually small, boneless creatures that live in their own shell house or shell-like partial exterior, dwelling in seas and oceans. Some other examples include 
Jawless fish
Armoured fish
Cartilaginous fish
Ray-finned fish
Lobe-finned fish.

There are more fish than four-limbed animals: there are over 33,000 described species of fish. Fish are usually covered with scales. They have two sets of paired fins and several unpaired fins. Most fish are cold-blooded (poikilotherm). 

There are many different kinds of fish. The thing to remember is that they all have adaptations, which are the features which let them live in the way they do. Yes, they do all live in water. But living in a fast-flowing river is different from living in a slow-moving river. In the sea, it matters the depth they live at. They live in fresh water in lakes and rivers (freshwater fish), and in salt water (marine fish) in the oceans. Some fish are less than one centimeter long. The largest fish is the whale shark, which can be almost 15 meters long and weigh 15 tons. Almost all fish live in the water. A group of fish called the lungfish have developed lungs because they live in rivers and pools which dry up in certain parts of the year. They burrow into mud and aestivate until the water returns.

The English word "fish" is not just one phylum. Some fish are more closely related to land animals than they are to other fish. For example, lobe-finned fish were the first animals with bones to come live on land, and all land animals are their descendants. Lobe-finned fish are more closely related to humans than to ray-finned fish.

Types of fish
"Fish" is not a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. Amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals all descended from lobe-finned fish. But the use of the term "fish" is so convenient that we go on using it.

Fish are the oldest vertebrate group. The term includes a huge range of types, from the Middle Ordovician, about 490 million years ago, to the present day. These are the main groups:

 Agnatha: the jawless fish. Cambrian to present day.
 Pteraspids: the head-shields
 Anaspids: gills opened as holes. Silurian to end-Devonian.
 Cephalaspids: early jawless fish
 Lampreys: living ectoparasites
 Osteostraci: bony-armoured jawless fish.
 Gnathostomata: the jawed fish. Includes all types commonly called fish, except the lamprey.
 Placoderms: heavily armoured fish
 Chondrichthyes: cartilaginous fish: sharks, rays and skates.
 Acanthodii: extinct spiny sharks
 Osteichthyes: bony fish.
 Actinopterygii: the ray-finned fish.
 Chondrostei: sturgeons and some other early types.
 Neopterygii: first seen in the later Permian, lighter and faster-moving than previous groups.
 Holostei: the gars and bowfins
 Teleostei: the most successful group, Triassic to present day.
 Sarcopterygii: the lobe-finned fish
 Dipnoi: the lungfish; eight genera survive.
 Coelacanths: two species survive. They were probably a sister-group to the tetrapods.

Certain animals that have the word fish in their name are not really fish: crayfish are Crustacea, and jellyfish are Cnidaria. Some animals look like fish, but are not. Whales and dolphins are mammals, for example.

Bony and cartilaginous fish
Most kinds of fish have bones. Some kinds of fish, such as sharks and rays, do not have real bones. Their skeletons are made of cartilage, and so they are known as cartilaginous fish.

Fish scales
All fish are covered with overlapping scales, and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale. Teleosts ('modern' fish) have what are called leptoid scales. These grow in concentric circles and overlap in a head to tail direction like roof tiles. Sharks and other chondrichthyes have placoid scales made of denticles, like small versions of their teeth. These also overlap in a head to tail direction, producing a tough outer layer. Shark skin is available for purchase as shagreen, a leather which as original is smooth in one direction, and rough in the other direction. It may be polished for use, but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping.

The scales are usually covered with a layer of slime which improves passage through the water, and makes the fish more slippery to a predator.

There are various types of eel: most are in the Anguilliformes. Their life-style has evolved many times. Eels have scales with smooth edges or are absent.

Freshwater fish
thumb|right|150px|Female rainbow trout
41% of all fish live in freshwater. There are also some important fish which breed in rivers, and spend the rest of their life in the seas. Examples are salmon, trout, the sea lamprey, and three-spined stickleback. Some fish are born in salt water, but live most of their mature lives in fresh water: for example the eels.
Species like these change their physiology to cope with the amount of salt in the water.

Saltwater fish
150px|thumb|right|Peacock damselfish
59% of fish live in saltwater and are known as marine fish. Some of the common marine fish are from the family Pomacentridae and sub-family Pomacentrinae. Many of the smaller, colourful marine fish are used in aquariums.

Swimming
Fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water. There are exceptions, but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body. This starts waves of flexion which travel the length of the body from nose to tail, generally getting larger as they go along. 

Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body & tail fin (caudal fin). However, there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins. The latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability. This is needed, for example, when living in coral reefs. Such fish cannot swim as fast as fish using their bodies & caudal fins.

Muscle
Fish can swim slowly for many hours using red muscle fibres. They also make short, fast bursts using white muscle. The two types of muscle have a fundamentally different physiology. The red fibres are continued in the middle of the body along the spine and usually alongside a much greater number of white fibres.

The white fibres get their energy by converting the carbohydrate glycogen to lactate (lactic acid). This is anaerobic metabolism, that is, it does not need oxygen. They are used for fast, short bursts. Once the lactic acid builds up in the muscles, they stop working, and it takes time for the lactate to be removed, and the glycogen replaced. Using their white fibres, fish can reach speeds of 10 lengths per second for short bursts. Fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly. Many live in the open ocean and swim constantly, like marlins, swordfish, and tuna. Land animals which change to living in the sea may develop (evolve) shapes similar to fishes. Ichthyosaurs, porpoises, dolphins, killer whales all have similar shapes. This is an example of convergent evolution.

Eel-like
The long, ribbon-like shape of an eel's body shows another shape. This enables them to hide in cracks, springing out quickly to capture prey, then returning quickly to their hiding spot.

Flatfish
thumb|230px|alt=a depressed flounder.|An adult flounder has both eyes on the upper side of its body.

Flatfish live on the bottom of the ocean or lake. Most use camouflage: they change colours to match the ocean floor. During their early lives, their eyes move to the upper side of their flat body.

Reef fish also have flat bodies, and their body is often highly coloured. Flat bodies can slip in and out among the corals, sponges, and rocks, avoiding predators. Angelfish, surgeonfish, and butterflyfish are examples.

Fish as food

240px|thumb|[[Koi (and goldfish) have been kept in decorative ponds for centuries in China and Japan]]
People eat many different kinds of fish. These include carp, cod, herring, perch, sardines, sturgeon, tilapia, trout, tuna, and many others. A person who buys and sells fish for eating is called a fishmonger.

The word to fish is also used for the activity of catching fishes. People catch fish with small nets from the side of the water or from small boats, or with big nets from big boats. People can also catch fish with fishing poles and fishhooks with bait. This is often called angling. Anglers also different types of fishing lures.

Because people are catching too many fish for food or other uses such as for sport, there are less and less fish in the sea. This is a problem known as overfishing.

Fish as pets
Selective breeding of carp made them into the domesticated koi in Japan, and goldfish in China. This breeding began over 2,000 years ago. The Chinese brought their goldfish indoors during the Song Dynasty. They kept them in large ceramic vessels. That we now do in glass fish tanks.

Foot (human)
Foot is also the name of a unit of measurement. See foot (unit).
thumb|Foot|100px
thumb|Foot|100px
thumb|140px|Bones in lower leg and foot
thumb|That male foot

A foot (one foot, two or more feet) is a body part on the end of a leg. It is used when walking. It is also important for balance: it helps people stand straight. People also use it to kick, in both fighting and sports, football being an example.

People's hands and feet have the same shape: they both have five digits (the fingers and toes). Many other animals with backbones also have five digits. The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the heel. The bottom of the foot is called the sole. 

Most land vertebrates have feet, and there are many different sorts of foot. The feet of monkeys are much like the hands. The hard foot of an ungulate is a hoof. When an animal has soft feet, or feet with soft parts on the underside, it is called a paw. Many invertebrates also have feet.

Many use footwear to protect themselves from weather and dirt. There are multiple kinds of footwear, for example sandals, shoes, and boots. When people do not remove footwear, especially in hot places or when they are very active, their feet can smell badly (foot odour). Wearing footwear that is too big or small can be bad for the feet, causing blisters. People who have foot, leg, and back problems can also get help from special shoes. 

People have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear. For example, in many countries, usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home. In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home. In Japan, people do not wear shoes in homes, and floors are often made of very soft materials. In Japan it is also important to keep the floors clean. In cultures where people always wear shoes, people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them. Not wearing shoes can be good for the feet, especially if they are damaged.

Conditions like Athlete's foot affect the feet, causing the feet to feel dry and cracked. Doctors who work with people's feet are podiatrists or chiropodists.

Bones
Half the bones in a human body are in the foot. There are 26 bones there. They are 14 phalanges (toes), 5 metatarsals (arch of the foot), and 7 tarsals (ankle bones).

France ( or ; ), officially the French Republic (, ), is a country in Western Europe. It also includes various departments and territories of France overseas. 

Mainland France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It is sometimes referred to as L’Hexagone ("The Hexagon") because of the shape of its territory. 

France is a unitary semi-presidential republic. The head of state is the President, who is also a politician. The Prime Minister is secondary to the President. 

Metropolitan France is bordered (clockwise from the North) by Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Andorra, and Spain. The overseas departments and collectives of France share land borders with Brazil and Suriname (bordering French Guiana), and the Netherlands Antilles (bordering Saint Martin). France is linked to the United Kingdom by the Channel Tunnel, which passes under the English Channel.

France is the largest country in the European Union and the second largest in Europe. It has been a major global power for centuries. During the 17th and 18th centuries, France colonized much of North America. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, France built one of the largest colonial empires of the time. This included large parts of North, West and Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and many Pacific Islands. France is a developed country and has a large economy. 

It is the most visited country in the world, with 82 million foreign visitors every year. 

France was one of the first members of the European Union, and has the largest land area of all members. It is also a founding member of the United Nations, and a member of the Francophonie, the G8, NATO, and the Latin Union. It is one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. France has the largest number of nuclear weapons with active warheads, and the largest number of nuclear power plants, in the European Union.

France's official language is French, which is also official in 29 other countries.

Geography and climate
France is in Western Europe. France shares its borders with Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Monaco, Andorra, and Spain. France has two mountain ranges near its borders: the Alps in the east and the Pyrenees in the south. In the north and the west of France, there are low hills and river valleys.

In France there are many different climates. The Atlantic has a major effect on the weather in the north and west. This means the temperature is about the same most of the year. It is in the marine west coast climate region. In the east, winters are cold and the weather is good. Summers are hot and stormy. In the south, winters are cool and wet. Summers are hot and dry. The north has a temperate climate similar to that of the United Kingdom and other Northern European countries.

France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world. It covers 11,035,000 km2 (4,260,637 sq mi). Only the United States has a larger one.

History
Name
The name "France" comes from the Latin word Francia, which means "land of the Franks".

Roman Gaul
The borders of modern France are about the same as those of ancient Gaulin which Celtic Gauls inhabited. Julius Caesar conquered Gaul for Rome in the 1st century BC. Eventually, the Gauls adopted the Romans' language,Latin, from which French evolved, and culture. Christianity first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD and became firmly established by the 4th and 5th centuries.

Franks
In the 4th century AD, the Germanic tribes, principally the Franks, invaded the Gauls, when the name Francie appeared. The modern name "France" comes from the name of the Capetian Kings of France around Paris. The Franks were the first tribe of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to the pope's Christianity, rather than Arianism. The French called themselves "the most Christian Kingdom of France".

The Treaty of Verdun (843), divided Charlemagne's Empire into three parts. The largest area was Western Francia and had borders that were similar to those of modern France.

Kingdom
Middle Ages
The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet became King of France. His descendants, the Direct Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon, unified the country with many wars and dynastic inheritance.

One of the most famous kings, Louis XIV, ruled from 1643 to 1715, the longest in French history.

Enlightenment
The monarchy was the most powerful during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. At the time, France had the largest population in Europe. The country had a large influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the common language of diplomacy in international affairs. Much of the Age of Enlightenment happened in France. French scientists made big scientific discoveries in the 18th century. France also conquered many overseas possessions in the Americas and Asia.

Republic
Napoleonic Wars
France had a monarchy until the French Revolution caused King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette, to be executed in 1793. Maximilien Robespierre was a dictator until he was executed himself in 1794. Thousands of other French citizens were killed. Napoleon Bonaparte took control of the republic in 1799. He later made himself Emperor of the First Empire (1804–1814). His armies conquered most of continental Europe. The metric system was invented by French scientists during the French revolution. That time 3 estates were developed.

After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was restortd. An interesting fact is that the French King Louis XIX was king for only 20 minutes from the time his father Charles X abdicated, to the time the July Monarchy started in 1830. Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon's nephew, came to power in 1848 and startd the Second Empire in 1852. He was removed after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. The Third Republic replaced his regime.

Colonialism
The large French colonial empire in the 19th century included parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia. The culture and the politics of those regions were influenced by France. Many countries that were French colonies stil have French as their official language.

World Wars
The country actively took part in both the World War I and World War II, with many battles against Germany taking place on its soil. During World War I, millions were killed in the trenches, including over a million at the Battle of the Somme. The conditions were extremely difficult for the soldiers on the front. The last surviving veteran was Pierre Picault, who died on 20 November 2008 at the age of 109.

During the World War II, Germany occupied France. The Allies landed in Normandy on 6 June 1944 and began the Battle of Normandy. The German forces lost France in just a few months.

Divisions
The 13 regions and 96 departments of metropolitan France include Corsica. France is divided into (administrative) regions:
 Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
 Bourgogne-Franche-Comté
 Brittany (Bretagne)
 Centre-Val de Loire
 Corsica (Corse)
 Grand Est
 Hauts-de-France
 Île-de-France
 Normandy (Normandie)
 Nouvelle-Aquitaine
 Occitanie
 Pays de la Loire
 Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur

Corsica has a different status than the other 12 metropolitan regions. It is called collectivité territoriale.

France also has five overseas regions:
 French Guiana (in South America)
 Guadeloupe (in the Caribbean)
 Martinique (in the Caribbean)
 Mayotte (in the Indian Ocean)
 Réunion (in the Indian Ocean)
These five overseas regions have the same status as the metropolitan ones. They are like the overseas American states of Alaska and Hawaii.

Then France is divided into 101 departments. The departments are divided into 342 arrondissements. The arrondissements are re-divided into 4,032 cantons. The smallest subdivision is the commune (there are 36,699 communes). On 1 January 2008, INSEE counted 36,781 communes in France. 36,569 of them are in metropolitan France and 212 of them are in overseas France.

Government
The government of France is a semi-presidential system determined by the constitution of the French Fifth Republic. It provides for a separation of powers.

The main ideals are expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The constitution declares the nation to be "an indivisible, secular, democratic, and social Republic". With a Prime Minister subordinate to the President, this slightly strange system was chosen by General Charles de Gaulle in 1958.

Military

The French armed forces has four branches:
 The Armée de Terre (Army)
 The Marine Nationale (Navy)
 The Armée de l'Air (Air Force)
 The Gendarmerie Nationale (a military force which acts as a National Rural Police)

France has about 359,000 military personnel. France spends 2.6% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense. This is the highest in the European Union. France and the UK spend 40% of the EU defence budget. About 10% of France's defence budget is for its nuclear weapons force.

Economy
thumb|The first completed [[Airbus A380 in Toulouse on 18 January 2005. Airbus is a symbol of the globalization of the French and European economy.]]

France is a member of the G8 group of leading industrialized countries. France has the eighth-largest economy in the world by Gross domestic product (GDP) (which takes into account how much it costs to live in different countries and inflation rates). France and 11 other European Union members jointly launched the euro on 1 January 1999 and started using it in 2002.

France's economy has nearly 2.9&nbsp;million registered companies. The government has a considerable influence over railway, electricity, aircraft, and telecommunications firms (as it owns big companies like SNCF and EDF (French electricity)). France has an important aerospace (design of aircraft and spacecraft) industry led by Airbus. It can also launch rockets from French Guiana.

France has invested a lot in nuclear power. This made France the smallest producer of carbon dioxide among the seven most industrialized countries in the world. As a result, 59 nuclear power plants generate most of the electricity produced in the country (78% in 2006, up from only 8% in 1973, 24% in 1980, and 75% in 1990).

France is the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe. France exports wheat, poultry, dairy products, beef, and pork. It is also famous for its wine industry. France received 10&nbsp;billion euros in 2006 from the European Community as subsidies to its farmers.

At one time, the Factory Act of 1833 limited the workday for women and children to 11&nbsp;hours a day.

Demographics
On 1 January 2008, it was estimated that 63.8&nbsp;million people live in France, including in the Overseas Regions of France. 61,875,000 of these live in metropolitan France, the part of the country that is within Europe. The significant minority groups living in France are:
 Teutonic, that is Germanic peoples

Culture

Language

French is the official language of France. It belongs to the Romance language group, which includes Italian and Spanish. Many regional dialects are also used in France. Alsatian, a German dialect, is spoken in Alsace and in parts of Lorraine in eastern France. French was the language of diplomacy and culture in Europe between the 17th and 19th century and is still widely used.

Some people in France also speak Basque, Breton, Catalan, Corsican, German, Flemish, and Occitan.

There is around 200,000 Romani speakers in France, 950,000 speakers of different Arabic dialects (plus 220,000 occasional speakers) and 1.5 – 2 million speakers of different Berber dialects.

 34% of French citizens responded that "they believe there is a God".
 27% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force".
 33% answered that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".

Literature

right|thumb|The Three Musketeers by [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]
French literature began in the Middle Ages. French was divided into several dialects at the time. Some authors spelled words differently from one other.

During the 17th century, Pierre Corneille, Jean Racine, Molière, Blaise Pascal and René Descartes were the main authors.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, French literature and poetry reached its best. The 18th century saw writings of authors, essayists and moralists as Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
As for French children's literature in those times, Charles Perrault wrote stories such as "Little Red Riding Hood", "Beauty and the Beast", "Sleeping Beauty" and "Puss in Boots".

Many famous French novels were written in the 19th century by authors such as Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas and Jules Verne. They wrote popular novels like The Three Musketeers, The Count of Monte-Cristo, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Les Misérables. Other 19th century fiction writers include Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal.

Famous novels were written during the 20th century by Marcel Proust, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Houellebecq.

Sports
right|thumb|The Peloton (means "pack" in French) of the [[Tour de France]]
The Tour de France cycling race in July is one of the best-known sporting events. It is a three-week race of around 3,500&nbsp;km that covers most of France and ends in the center of Paris, on the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. Football is another popular sport in France. The French team won the FIFA World Cup in 1998 and 2018. They also won the UEFA European Football Championship in 1984 and 2000. France also hosts the 24 Hours of Le Mans car race. France also hosted the Rugby World Cup in 2007 and finished fourth.
France is closely associated with the Modern Olympic Games. At the end of the 19th century, the Baron Pierre de Coubertin suggested having the Olympic Games again. France hosted the Summer Olympics twice, in 1900 and 1924, in Paris. France will host the Summer Olympics in 2024, in Paris. France also hosted the Winter Games three times: in 1924 in Chamonix, in 1968 in Grenoble, and in 1992 in Albertville.

=== Cuisine ===

French cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout Europe, and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world.

The roots of modern haute cuisine lie in chefs like La Varenne (1615–1678) and the notable chef of Napoleon, Marie-Antoine Carême (1784–1833). These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the Middle Ages. They used fewer spices, and more herbs and creamy ingredients.

Typical ingredients like roux and fish stock, and techniques such as marinading, and dishes such as ragout, were invented. Carême was an expert pâtissier (pastry-maker), and this is still a mark of French cooking. He developed basic sauces, his 'mother sauces'; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire, based on the half-dozen mother sauces.

French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier (1846–1935). He was a genius at organization. He worked out how to run large restaurants, as in a big hotel or a palace; how the staff should be organized; how the menu was prepared. He had methods for everything. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Hotel in London, the Hôtel Ritz Paris, and some of the greatest cruise ships.

Escoffier, however, left out much of the culinary character to be found in the regions of France.
