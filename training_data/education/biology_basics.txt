Introduction to Biology

Biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment. It encompasses many fields from molecular biology to ecology.

Cells are the basic units of life. All living things are made of cells. Cells contain genetic material in the form of DNA. DNA carries instructions for building and maintaining organisms.

Evolution explains how species change over time through natural selection. Organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce. This process leads to adaptation and diversity.

Ecology studies how organisms interact with their environment. Ecosystems consist of living organisms and non-living components. Energy flows through ecosystems in food chains and food webs.

Genetics examines how traits are inherited from parents to offspring. Genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins. Mutations in genes can lead to variation in traits.
