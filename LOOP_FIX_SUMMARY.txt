LOOP FIX - COMPLETE SUCCESS
================================================================================

Date: Friday, January 9, 2026

THE BUG:
  System stuck outputting "wo wo wo" instead of "world"
  
  Root Cause: When edges had equal weight (255), scoring function
  selected wrong edge (space instead of 'r'), creating infinite loop:
  w → o → ' ' → w → o → ' ' → w...

THE FIX:
  Added edge order tiebreaker (1 line of code):
  float edge_order_bonus = (float)i * 0.01f;
  score += edge_order_bonus;
  
  Later edges get small bonus, winning ties.

RESULTS:

Simple Pattern ("hello world"):
  BEFORE: 77.8% error, output "wo wo wo"
  AFTER:  0.0% error, output "world" ✅
  
  ✅ Perfect accuracy from iteration 10 onwards
  ✅ Stable through 1000 iterations
  ✅ Graph: 9 nodes, 13 edges (efficient)
  ✅ avgW: 239 (bounded, stable)

Complex Patterns ("the cat" + "the dog"):
  BEFORE: Both → loops with "ca ca ca"
  AFTER:  Different outputs (discrimination working!)
  
  ⚠️ Still has pattern interference
  ⚠️ "the cat" outputs "ran" instead of "sat"
  ✅ No more infinite loops

WHAT'S FIXED:
  ✅ "wo wo wo" loop completely eliminated
  ✅ Simple patterns: 0% error
  ✅ Stable over 1000+ iterations
  ✅ Fast learning (0% by iteration 10)
  ✅ No catastrophic forgetting

WHAT STILL NEEDS WORK:
  ⚠️ Pattern interference in complex sequences
  ⚠️ Context discrimination for shared prefixes
  ⚠️ Loop detection could trigger earlier

CONCLUSION:
  The fix COMPLETELY SOLVES the "wo wo wo" loop bug.
  Simple patterns now work perfectly (0% error).
  Complex patterns improved but need stronger context discrimination.
